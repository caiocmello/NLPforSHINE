      "['Share on Facebook\\nFor as long as the Olympics have been running, eager host cities have expected them to do far more than entertain the world’s TV audience for just under two and a half weeks. While they might cost more to hold than they immediately earn back, they’re meant to leave behind a “legacy”, a conveniently vague notion taking in well-maintained stadiums and sport-loving children. As no less an authority than the International Olympic Association says, the games are expected to leave behind “more than just good memories”.\\xa0\\nIn some cities, the Games deliver on this hazy prophecy. Others are left with ghost town Olympic villages and “white elephant” stadiums*. Debt can be another a nasty reminder of the Games’ excesses: the Quebec government ended up introducing a new tax on tobacco to pay off Montreal’s whopping Olympic bill. Damaging Olympic legacies may well have contributed to the general lack of interest in hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics (all but two cities have dropped out of the bidding process ).\\nSo why do some games leave golden legacies, while others take the metaphorical form of a large, destructive pet?\\n“Sydney’s games apparently accelerated the growth of ‘brand Australia’ by 10 years”\\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) publishes a factsheet outlining the long-lasting benefits for its host cities. For some, even the length of the entry speaks volumes: Vancouver 2010 gets two pages; Nagano, Japan just a quarter of a page.\\nMore damning are those reports in which airy, untestable claims are presented in place of concrete achievements. In Beijing, for example, 400 million schoolchildren were apparently “exposed to Olympic values”, while Sydney’s games “accelerated the growth of ‘brand Australia’ by ten years”. Other reports have shown that Sydney’s games drove more people to watch TV than ever before – a positive effect for the country’s networks, but arguably not top of the priority list for anyone else.\\xa0\\nLast February, former US presidential candidate Mitt Romney wrote an op-ed slamming excess spending on the games, and arguing that Greece’s $11bn spend on Athens 2004 “pushed the country towards collapse”. He had a point: Athens constructed purpose-built sporting venues a long way out of town. These are now rarely used and barely maintained, with stopped clocks and damaged facilities that have become the subject of photo essay after photo essay .\\xa0\\nYet Barcelona, which reportedly spent $9.3bn on the 1992 Games – the equivalent of $12.5bn in 2004 – remains one of the biggest Olympic success stories. The key was the city’s decision to spend only 9.1 per cent of its budget on the operating costs of the Games themselves; the remaining $8.5bn, the vast majority of the funding, went on improving the city’s transport and services and constructing two miles of beach on a stretch of coast previously occupied by industrial buildings\\nBarcelona’s Port Vell harbour, built for the 1992 games. Image: Diliff at Wikimedia Commons.\\nThe Sochi winter games cost $51bn, the highest price tag ever recorded. Human rights abuses, stories of bribery and logistical mess-ups (what better way to generate bad press than putting up journalists in unfinished hotels ?) marred the image of the Games themselves.\\nYet Sochi was far from a straightforward tale of failure: the Games kickstarted long-lasting development in the region, including the completion of an airport (which had been on pause since 1989) and improvements to power, telecommunications and access for the disabled.\\nThe success stories, on the whole, are those which prioritised forward planning at the expense of the wow-factor. Before the 1984 LA Olympics, officials decided that only two sporting facilities would be built for the Games. That meant the \\xa0$413m cost of the event – a snip compared to the $1.35bn spent by Moscow four years before – was almost entirely spent on other projects. The profits from the games were reinvested into projects like LA84 , a youth sporting foundation.\\nCompare and contrast with Montreal’s 1976 Games, which may well have the worst legacy of all. The greatest disaster was, unsurprisingly, the stadium. Construction originally cost at $770m; by the time the debts were finally paid off 30 years later, the figure had reached $1.5bn.\\nMontreal’s Olympic stadium, paid for by the city’s smokers. Image: Tolivero at Wikimedia Commons.\\nLondon had a near-miss. In 2008, mayor Boris Johnson slammed the lack of post-Games proposals for the Olympic park, and final plans for the park were not unveiled until August 2012, weeks after the Games’ completion. Better managed were the original proposals for the sporting structures. Of the venues used, 95 per cent were hired out, while 25 temporary venues were constructed. The permanent venues have been converted for community use, leaving the city with no looming, useless sporting structures. The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, which opened to the public in July 2013, has already received over 1 million visitors, and, in the words of London’s mayor, Boris Johnson, forms the “glittering centrepiece” of the post-Olympics regeneration effort in East London.\\nIt looks like Germany, at least, has learnt these lessons. Both Berlin and Hamburg have put forward remarkably restrained proposals for the 2024 Summer Olympics; both feature inner-city building and the reuse of existing venues, too.\\nThere’s no one size fits all formula for a successful legacy – not least because the challenges facing host cities in advanced economies are so different to the ones facing emerging ones. According to the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development , the cost to emerging markets is usually higher; as in Sochi, however, investment purportedly for the Games can be used to boost infrastructure and living conditions, making the return on this investment look pretty worthwhile. The lasting legacy of the Beijing Olympics is not its Birdcage stadium, now touted to be transformed into a shopping and entertainment centre: it’s in the improvements to sanitation, air quality and transport that came with it.\\n\\xa0\\n*This phrase “white elephant”, incidentally, comes from a story in which Siamese kings gave the animals to annoying courtiers, as they would cost so much to maintain or dispose of that they would ruin the recipient. So, now you know.\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'Share on Facebook\\nThe recent publication of consultancy Moore Stephens’ report into London’s Olympic Stadium has reasserted the importance of the concept of legacy in London’s post-Olympic landscape.\\nIn 169 pages, the report meticulously outlines the various failings in the conversion of the London Stadium from an Olympic venue to West Ham United FC’s Premier-League new home. A sizeable proportion reads as a direct criticism of mayor Sadiq Khan’s predecessor, Boris Johnson, and his questionable decisions about the bidding process to occupy the stadium.\\nWhen West Ham were awarded tenancy in the London Stadium (for the second time), it was championed as a great success by organisers who had secured a legacy for the iconic venue. However, we seem to have reached a rather embarrassing point in this ‘secured legacy’. Its publicly owned operator, E20, is losing money with each game played; and West Ham have been granted a very favourable deal at the expense of the British taxpayer. As well as this, West Ham’s first season was marred by fan violence, security issues, and poor performances on the pitch. While this may not officially be a white elephant, it is at least a claret-and-blue one.\\nThe recent revelations concerning the London Stadium have brought the broader problems of Olympic legacy into sharp focus. What is legacy? Can it be measured? Whose legacy are we talking about it? Who is entitled to claim the success or failure of legacy?\\nFrom the get-go, the London 2012 bid was oriented around this notion of legacy, and although the promises were subtly realigned over the years, two pillars stood firm throughout. First, was to encourage and increase participation in sport. Second, was the widespread regeneration of a previously “under-developed”, post-industrial part of east London, Stratford.\\nLondon’s success in winning the bid over competitors such as Paris lay in its optimistic teleology. Put simply, it explained, legitimated, and planned the 16-day spectacle as a function of its legacy. London was adamant that it would not repeat the failures of preceding games . It would not become a desolate wasteland littered with white elephants, but instead would become a “new piece of the city” stitched into its regenerating surroundings.\\nLegacy is an immensely powerful concept in Olympic urbanism, but is also incredibly vague. Both its breadth and its haziness explain its allure. It offers up visions of a future city, yet sits uncomfortably with the rest of the Olympic project.\\nOlympic time is characterised by a rigid linearity. The achievements of its athletes are measured against the clock, all events take place within a 16-day period, and the games run in cycles of four years. So a tension exists between the ephemerality of the games themselves, and the permanence of their effects. The pre-game phase is characterised by planning, deadlines, and most importantly, the date of the opening ceremony. Time is a fixed entity with an immovable end point. The most important consideration for the host city is to deliver the games on time. Compare this to after the games have moved on, where time exists in a much more fluid and uncertain way.\\nThere are also interesting differences between “legacy” and “impact”. Whilst impacts are generally short-term and measurable, legacy is framed as a longer-term issue. The Olympics clearly have impacts on the city, but legacy is an abstract idea, a discourse used to justify hosting the Games.\\nIn 2007, the Greater London Authority named its five legacy promises : increasing opportunities for Londoners to become involved in sport; ensuring Londoners benefit from new jobs, businesses and volunteering opportunities; transforming the heart of East London; delivering a sustainable games and developing sustainable communities; and, showcasing London as a diverse, creative and welcoming city.\\nTaking the third of these promises – transforming the heart of East London – it becomes clear how vague legacy is. That statement begs a number of questions. What does transformation mean, and how is it measured? Where is the heart of east London? Who decides how east London is spatially defined?\\nOr, take “developing sustainable communities”. What does a sustainable community mean? Does this imply that previous communities were unsustainable? What does this say about how local people are viewed in relation to the construction of the Olympic spectacle?\\nThe vision: an artist’s imrpession of the London Olympic Park, before construction began. Image: London 2012.\\nHow, then, should we begin to analyse or interpret London’s Olympic legacy? Can legacy ever be achieved and come to an end? If so, when can it be fairly interpreted? Considering the London Stadium as either a successful securing of legacy, or as a pyrrhic victory in the battle against white elephant-ism, nevertheless assumes a fixed point in time. Even if at this specific moment the London Stadium seems to be an embarrassment of failings, this situation may change now it has been taken back under mayoral control.\\nAny discussion of London’s urban Olympic legacy must consider that it does not exist in a vacuum, but must be contextualised by broader urban histories and contexts. Outcomes and impacts linked to processes beyond the Games become classified as purely Olympic-led urban phenomenon, massively simplifying the ways in which urban space develops.\\nBecause legacy is such a multifaceted concept, how can it be fairly unpacked and re-assembled to make an informed decision about whether hosting the Olympics was “worth it”? Is it even possible to measure legacy?\\nSo should the overall legacy of the games be judged on the recent stadium report? Or should it be measured in line with the stadium’s recent Instagram post , celebrating the fact that the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park is the UK’s fourth-most instagrammed sports location this year? Sadly, the latter increasingly seems like a desirable metric by which urban regeneration schemes should be assessed.\\nWhile legacy was originally championed to get hesitant members of the public onside and promise them vague visions of a future over which they have now control, legacy discourse now serves to legitimate significant decisions and smooth-over failures in planning large-scale urban regeneration projects.\\nSo far, if 2012 has taught us anything about Olympic legacy, perhaps it is how flawed the idea of promising legacy is. What begins as a vague discourse inevitably becomes transformed by political cycles, and in this instance, the 2008 financial crash and subsequent years of austerity.\\nDespite the problematic nature of this legacy discourse, this does not mean that east London would have been better off had it not hosted the Games. However, regeneration could certainly have been managed far better to channel the benefits of Olympic urbanism to those impacted most by the games.\\nThis positive-negative legacy dynamic pervades most areas of Olympic urbanism, and makes it very difficult to decide whether hosting the Olympics is positive or negative for cities. All in all, the opaque nature of Olympic legacy adds to its mythic nature and enduring urban appeal.\\nBenedict Vigers is a postgraduate student at the University of Cambridge, currently studying an MPhil in architecture & urban studies.\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'Share on Facebook\\nEver since the 1992 games in Barcelona, the idea of “legacy” has played a crucial role in the process of bidding for, and hosting, the Olympics. It’s easy to agree that investment and development for the Olympics should deliver benefits for residents of the host city in the long run. And it makes sense that Olympic infrastructure is built in areas that need improvement.\\nBut in practice, it’s not always locals who benefit from the Olympic legacy. All too often, strict deadlines for delivery of Olympic infrastructure give authorities and developers a license to push urban regeneration plans through to approval with minimal consultation. In Beijing, for instance, 1.5m people were displaced to make space for Olympic venues. Meanwhile, in Rio, thousands of favela dwellers experienced violent evictions ahead of this year’s games.\\nSimilarly – but somehow less famously – the Olympic Park developments for London 2012 involved the largest programme of legally enforced evictions in England. And it continues to this day.\\nWelcome to Hackney Wick\\nHackney Wick and Fish Island is a quaint, former industrial area in east London, right at the edge of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Old warehouses – many of which have been converted into spaces for living, working, eating and making – sit beside canals, and old-fashioned barges line the banks. Here, more than 600 artist studios and other small creative organisations have produced an ecosystem which nurtures innovation and creativity.\\nA creative idyll. Image: Ilaria Pappalepore/University of Westminster/author provided.\\nNow this area is part of a major regeneration project and most of these artists feel under threat. Currently, one group of creatives based in Fish Island is fighting an eviction letter delivered just six weeks before part of the building where the individuals work and live is due to be demolished.\\nThe building – Vittoria Wharf – is one of many which were subject to compulsory purchase before the games by the London Legacy Development Corporation – the public company responsible for delivering Olympic-led regeneration in east London.\\nA petition to save Vittoria Wharf from demolition has so far reached more than 2,700 signatures. But this action is unlikely to save the building – at best, it will give residents a few more months to make their case public. A local musician said to me: “I feel they almost treat us as Conquistadors treated native Americans, with no respect for our philosophies.”\\nPutting up a fight Image: Ilaria Pappalepore/University of Westminster/author provided.\\nThese residents are aware of the well-documented cycle of gentrification , which sees deprived neighbourhoods initially inhabited by young artists, who are later displaced by established creative companies and middle-class residents.\\nNew creative enclaves are commonly formed in cities this way over time. But in London, young artists worry that soon there will be nowhere left for them to go in the city. One of the residents of Hackney Wick told me that artists’ only option is to relocate to other parts of England – such as Margate on the east coast – or to go abroad, with Berlin the most popular option. With the average London house price pushing £472,000, and rent becoming prohibitively expensive in more and more boroughs, there is a real danger that low-income artists could be priced out.\\nLooking back at London 2012\\nLocal artists’ difficulties with the legacy of the Olympics follows their disappointment with the games themselves. Research I conducted between 2010 and 2014 showed that the games had minimal positive impacts on local artists and other small creative organisations.\\nMany were disappointed by how difficult it proved for local artists and companies to take part in the cultural programme of London 2012. A key problem flagged up by my interviewees was the curators’ preference for internationally renowned artists over local ones. Unfortunately, this stems from the nature of mega-events, which are highly dependent on sponsorships and international media attention.\\nBut as one cultural policy consultant interviewed for the research said:\\n[The cultural programme curators] saw themselves as trying to do something substantially different and of better quality and more international and a lot more contemporary than a lot of the practice they thought they were looking at in east London. Not to take seriously any of the talent that is on their doorstep, except around the edges and kind of cosmetically, seems to me to be fundamentally misdirected.\\nIn Hackney Wick, organisers went so far as to remove graffiti by local artists, only to replace it with specially-commissioned pieces by international artists. In many ways, London missed an invaluable opportunity to promote local creativity.\\nEvocative art in Hackney Wick, by Edwin. Image: Mabacan/Flickr/creative commons.\\nFor security reasons visitors were carefully marshalled between train stations and Olympic venues, which prevented them from wandering around the area. What’s more, the International Olympic Committee’s extremely restrictive copyright rules made it impossible for local artists to use Olympic-related symbols in their practice – although some did so anyway as a form of resistance.\\nA new cultural quarter?\\nYet the Olympic regeneration programme did have a small number of positive outcomes for local residents. One of the very few aspects which seems to have been well received by the artists we spoke to is the plan for a culture and education district , to be built on the Stratford waterfront in the Olympic park by 2020.\\nThis project – dubbed “Olympicopolis” by former London mayor Boris Johnson – was initially inspired by “Albertopolis”; the cultural cluster built in South Kensington following the Great Exhibition in 1851. The new cultural district will accommodate world class cultural and education institutions such as the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A), Sadler’s Wells theatre, University College London (UCL) and London College of Fashion. Both UCL and the V&A have already liaised with local Hackney Wick artists, with a view to develop creative collaborations.\\nThe project is expected to create 3,000 jobs, and contribute to the wider cultural legacy strategy for the Olympic Park, which is “centred around developing east London as a creative destination with an international reputation”.\\nBut given what happened at London 2012, there’s a real risk that this new development could, once again, create a “tourist bubble” – a sanitised cultural island, completely separated from the local neighbourhood. Indeed, the plans for the new district – which were unveiled very recently – have already been described as “a cacophony of luxury stumps”.\\nPrevious research has shown that successful creative areas are characterised by a diverse built environment, a bohemian look and the coexistence of people who produce and consume culture. Yet all of this already exists in Hackney Wick and Fish Island, thanks to a community which has been there since long before the Olympics. The question is – will it still be there in five years?\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

The cidade maravilhosa – the “Marvelous City” – was cold and dark, the furthest thing from the vibrant, jovial landscapes you’ll see on a Google image search.\\nThe rain didn’t deter thousands of workers pulling 12-hour shifts to finish construction for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but the overall mood was just as gloomy; 12 May was also the day that the Brazilian senate voted to suspend President Dilma Rousseff and begin an impeachment trial.\\nI’ve been to Rio dozens of times, and because I’m a scholar of modern architecture and public space, I couldn’t help but look at how the city had changed, for better or worse, in preparation for the Summer Olympic Games.\\nAs I rode via Uber for two hours from Rio to the airport, seeing construction everywhere, I knew how closely related it was to the country’s political problems. Kickbacks from large infrastructure projects were used to finance campaigns of all major political parties.\\nI started asking myself the question that I’m sure every citizen of Rio will entertain, in one way or another, in the near future. Was is worth it? What would be the legacy of all this construction – if not the demolition of Brazilian democracy happening right before our eyes?\\nThe construction frenzy tied to the Olympics should lead to much-needed infrastructure improvements, and the Rio Olympics did spur the development of a number of museums and cultural institutions. But that development – often conducted behind closed doors, with little public accountability – has come at a cost.\\nBuildings that benefit whom?\\nTwo blocks after leaving my hotel, my Uber passed one of these new museums: the MIS ( Museu da Imagem e do Som , or “Museum of Image and Sound”).\\nAn elegant and complex structure designed by American architects Diller, Scofidio and Renfro, the building – which broke ground in 2014 but won’t be ready in time for the Olympics – projects a series of ramps on the main facade. The visitors will have a hard time deciding if they should look to the collection inside or to the bright Copacabana beach outside. I commend the architects for offering the choice instead of blocking the view (as others proposed). Nevertheless, a recent Ph.D. dissertation by scholar Lidia Quieto revealed how opaque the competition process – organized by the powerful Roberto Marinho Foundation, the cultural arm of the Brazilian media conglomerate Rede Globo – really was.\\nThe Museum of Image and Sound remains under construction. Image: Marcelo Horn/Wikimedia Commons.\\nDoes it have to be like that? Could an architectural competition be held with transparency and public spirit in mind?\\nApparently, not in Rio.\\nThis general disregard for the public good has bled over to other decisions tied to Olympics. Years ago I interviewed Gabriel Solis, a San Antonio-based architect who served on the jury of the competition for the Rio Olympic Park. The proposed location sat on marshlands that are extremely sensitive to land removal and vulnerable to erosion. But Solis told me that environmental concerns were simply cast aside during the decision-making process. At the time – in 2014 – Solis was happy that the jury had at least managed to guarantee the permanence of Vila Autódromo, an informal settlement that occupied a tiny part of the site.\\nTwo years later, on the verge of the opening of the Olympic Games, Vila Autódromo is no more . Because the developers didn’t want a favela anywhere near the apartments they’d need to sell after the Olympic Games, the city negotiated with individual occupants and demolished their houses as soon as they agreed to leave. Living in the middle of rubble and under the threat of forced relocation, the majority of the families accepted the city’s cash offer and left. The 25 families that resisted until the end will still have their homes demolished, but will be able to inhabit new ones built in their place.\\nThe pluses and minuses of the new port\\nMy Uber continued to downtown Rio, where people weren’t so lucky. The redevelopment of the port area – Porto Maravilha – removed 22,059 families from their homes .\\nBut the port area also contains one of the few positive outcomes of Rio 2016: the demolition of the Perimetral , a double-decker highway that used to snake along the seashore. As we rode through the congested streets of downtown Rio on that rainy afternoon, the traffic wasn’t ideal. But it also wasn’t any worse than it was a few years ago with the elevated highway. Visiting Paço Municipal (the old imperial residence) and viewing Guanabara Bay – unobstructed by the Perimetral – is a sight to behold.\\nThe Perimetal, under demolition in 2013. Image: Getty.\\nHalf a mile north are two new museums: one that celebrates everything good about contemporary architecture and one that epitomises everything wrong with it. The Museu de Arte do Rio (Rio’s Museum of Art) is the good one. Here two existing buildings were renovated by the firm Bernardes Jacobsen; they’re now connected by an elegant new canopy that creates a pleasant terrace. It doesn’t hurt that the Museu de Arte also has a wonderful collection of art, with a focus on works that have made Rio their subject matter.\\nAcross the Museu de Arte, sitting on a white-stoned platform that is blinding on sunny days, is a strange metallic structure designed by world-famous Santiago Calatrava. Called Museu do Amanhã (“Museum of Tomorrow”), it seems to be no more than a symbol of a lost opportunity. The museum has no collection, just a series of virtual displays; when I visited, the exhibits couldn’t hold my attention for more than a few seconds each. What I did notice was how foreign and unfit that big white skeleton looked in Rio. Did I mention that, much like the Olympics , Calatrava’s projects are notorious for going way over budget ?\\nA model of city building gone awry\\nAs the Olympic Games begin, it has become clear that Rio 2016 is already a missed opportunity. The subway extension to Barra da Tijuca will operate only on a limited schedule (probably for Olympic ticket-holders only). The light rail downtown will also operate on a reduced course. Of the two big architectural monuments tied to the Olympic Games, one will not be ready (Museu da Imagem e do Som) and the other (Museu do Amanhã) isn’t worth a visit. Thousands of families were displaced; thousands of apartments will take their place and make gentrification worse than it already is.\\nYes, the Bus Rapid Transit lines are working fine, while both the TransOeste and the TransCarioca bus corridors are operating at full capacity, serving half a million people everyday and reducing carbon emissions by 40 percent. But one new piece of infrastructure has already collapsed : On April 21, a 50-foot-long piece of a dedicated bicycle lane that had opened in January collapsed into the ocean, killing three cyclists.\\nAll this should be just another case of bad infrastructure planning and investment. But it’s much worse. Over the past 20 years, Rio has implemented an entire model of city building that’s relied on gentrification, campaign finance kickbacks and forced relocations; now that model is being used by the entire country. As the New York Times recently wrote, the political party that ruined Rio is the same that is supporting a coup against Dilma Rousseff.\\nIt’s sad that the Rio 2016 Olympics might be remembered for three collapses: the demolition of the downtown Perimetral highway (1960-2016), the collapse of the bicycle lane (January to April 2016) and the implosion of Brazilian democracy (1985-2016).\\nRebuilding the last will be an Olympic proposition.\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation . Read the original article .\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'Share on Facebook\\nThe modern Olympics have always been inescapably urban events. Since Athens 1896, the games have moved around host cities every four years (with the exceptions of both world wars). Over this time, they have become the world’s largest sporting and cultural spectacle.\\nThe history of the urban Olympics does not follow a linear narrative, however: over time, the relationships between the Olympics and their urban form have changed substantially. The 1908 London games, for example, were the first to introduce a piece of specifically Olympic architecture, in the form of the White City Stadium that would house most Olympic events. But those games had relatively little impact on London as a whole.\\nTowards the mid twentieth century, Olympic urbanisation expanded to the construction of special Olympic Quarters. Los Angeles 1932 built the first Olympic village, incorporating housing into Olympic urbanism. Not to be outdone, Hitler’s Berlin Games of 1936 pushed forward an Olympics of monumentalism, spectacle, and propaganda, and were the first Olympics to be televised.\\nHelsinki introduced the first proper Olympic Park in 1952, a policy Melbourne copied four years later. But it was Rome 1960 that really represents the key watershed in the history of Olympic urbanism. This was the first time that the Olympics were used as a catalyst and legitimator of rapid and widespread urban transformation and infrastructural renewal.\\nThe scale and cost of the Rome games was seen as so excessive that calls were made for the 1964 games to be cancelled. In the event, though, Tokyo took Rome’s extravagance even further. As a result, fewer cities bid for the 1968 games: most possible hosts feared they’d simply become too big and expensive. In 1968, the eventual winner, Mexico City, chose to rely on existing infrastructure and sporting arenas, and to host a much less lavish version of the Olympics.\\nLos Angeles 1984 was another transformative Olympics – not in its use of existing sports facilities, but in its commercial success and reliance on the private sector and corporate sponsorship. This signalled the collision of Olympism with full-fledged consumer capitalism.\\nIn 1992, Barcelona used the Olympics to regenerate a large portion of its formerly-industrial or under-developed urban fabric, and adopted a long-term vision of Olympic-led urban change – or, as we know it now, legacy. Fast forward twenty years, and London 2012 built on Barcelona’s vision to regenerate a disadvantaged corner of east London. There, the Olympics intersected with long-standing regeneration initiatives in the East End, and aimed to establish socio-economic ‘convergence’ with the rest of London.\\nAs the brief and limited examples above demonstrate, the relationship between the Olympic Games and the urban form has been historically contingent and dynamic. Some cities cluster events around a small and well defined Olympic Park; others, such as Tokyo 2020, disperse events more evenly around the city.\\nOver the last few decades, and especially since Los Angeles 1984, cities’ motivation for bidding to host the Olympics have been as competitive as athletes’ motivations for taking part. In a global political economy defined by inter-urban competition, cities are forced to compete with one another to attract international investment, tourism, and the creative class, all in the name of ‘getting ahead’.\\nAs a result, urban governance – especially in the post-industrial cities of the Global North – has become increasingly entrepreneurial in outlook, prioritising economic growth and creativity over the provision of social welfare. Cities in competition with each other are concerned with their own image. A positive, dynamic and innovative urban image is hugely important in advertising urban space.\\nThe Olympics have come to offer a valuable way for cities to attract investment, become the centre of global attention, and push through urban regeneration schemes that might otherwise have been too contentious or unpopular to succeed. The Olympics not only regenerate a city’s urban fabric and infrastructure, but also reimage the city as a successful place. Or so the narrative goes.\\nIn recent years, the urban Olympic spectacle has been underpinned by new forms of governance and power dynamics in delivering the Games, and new forms of representing what it means to be an Olympic City. It is assumed that the city must present an image of cohesion, and be a place lacking in conflict. This became a problem for Rio in 2016 – a city which wanted to enhance its prestige on the world stage, but whose favelas presented organisers with an ‘image problem’.\\nThe organisers chose two solutions to their ‘problem’. First, the favelas ‘became invisible’. Many were either bulldozed or hidden behind new walls. Some were airbrushed out of maps and from media images. Secondly, the favelas were visibly ‘pacified’, either through massive police intervention, or by simply painting them in bright and playful colours to disassociate them from their reputation for crime and poverty.\\nThe image of the Olympic City broadcast to the world is a necessarily partial one. It must exclude those who do not fit its narrative, those who might be deemed troublesome or prohibitive to investment. Now more than ever, it seems that large numbers of people are realising that they do not fit into this urban spectacle.\\nThe Olympics have always been the locus of protest – but now the scope and scale of urban protests against the games are expanding and starting much earlier in the Olympic cycle. Rather than retroactively challenging the way Olympic-led urban development materialises, broad coalitions of actors are now challenging the Olympics at their source: the bid.\\nFor the first time in generations, sustained normative questions are being asked of the Olympics and the games’ relationship to the urban. As well as the success of protests, this fragility has been cloven apart by the exposure of state-sponsored doping , corruption within the IOC and the growing visibility of redundant structures littered across former host cities . In short, the negative dimensions of the Olympic spectacle are now well known.\\nConsider the recent bidding process for the 2024 games. Boston cancelled its bid because of a lack of public support. \\xa0Hamburg pulled out after a referendum of its residents. Rome’s bid collapsed due to financial difficulties, and finally Budapest pulled the plug after 260,000 people signed a petition against hosting the games.\\nOlympic Lanes: one of the less popular innovations of London 2012. Image: Getty.\\nThis left only Paris and Los Angeles. With no other candidates, Paris and LA were awarded the 2024 and 2028 games respectively. This was an unprecedented decision by the IOC, one surely made to try and stabilise a global movement under growing pressure. Both bids highlighted the re-use of existing facilities, and the construction of temporary venues to avoid massive overspends and a legacy zoo filled with white elephants.\\nIt seems fair to say that another period of Olympic restructuring is under way. Looking ahead to 2032, interesting propositions are entering the pipeline that are potentially game-changing. The Olympic Charter states that the Olympics can only be awarded to a host city, rather than a country: the whole identity of the Olympics as a global movement is predicated on cities.\\nThis is why the Rhein-Ruhr 2032 is so significant. It proposes a multi-city Olympics, across 13 cities centred on Düsseldorf. It will host 80 per cent of events in existing venues. Even though this region sees itself as a larger metropolitan space, it nevertheless comprises several distinct cities.\\nCompared to clustered morphologies of previous Games, this could represent a new era of hosting the Olympics: an era that dials back on the excesses of spectacle, gigantism, and ‘starchitecture’. It envisages games that does not involve the mass displacement of local residents through Compulsory Purchase Orders or the power of Eminent Domain. It aspires to be a games that does not leave expensive architectural reminders of a transient festival to be paid for by the taxpayer. It hopes to be era in which Olympic hosts are still able to invest a fair and progressive amount to vital public services.\\nBut perhaps we should not underestimate the power of the Olympic movement to reinvent itself. There has never been a consistently defined modality of Olympic urbanism. The IOC remains immensely powerful, in spite of its recent self-inflicted wounds.\\nThe future remains unclear. We can only hope that recent trends usher in a new, less destructive, more democratic iteration of the Olympics as an urban spectacle.\\nWhy not listen to the episode of our podcast, Skylines , about the Olympics and the city?\\xa0\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'London 2012: $11bn\\nRio 2016: $15bn or more (over two decades following the event)\\nWhile the exact cost of any Olympics is difficult to pin down, and is often a point of contention, the last three games witnessed unparalleled public and private investment. Beijing, London and Rio have built longer term “legacy” planning into their budgets, to try to ensure that investment in hosting the games continues to pay off for years after the event.\\nOlympic legacies are hard to come by. Rio. Image: Dany13/Flickr.\\nSuch legacy promises often promote infrastructure redevelopment, improved transportation systems, economic growth and job creation, projects of urban renewal and regeneration, improved physical activity participation and environmental sustainability. In Rio, planned infrastructure developments are set to continue through to 2030 .\\nThe financial undertaking for such bids – and the subsequent planning and implementation – is nothing short of enormous. Undoubtedly, the most significant cost relates to the (re)development of urban infrastructure. This leads us to our second deterrent.\\n2. Infrastructure challenges\\nHosting a mega-event always involves urban renewal and regeneration. Yet developing the sporting stadia, accommodation and transportation networks to cope with increased numbers of tourists and athletes is anything but straightforward. Before refashioning the urban landscape, planners must know which sites are to be redeveloped, for whom, and to what end.\\nClearly, catering to the demands of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is one priority – but arguably, it is the least significant. Rather, planners seek to capitalise on urban space by re-imagining the city as a recreational environment – a resource for tourism and consumerism. Retail, festival, sporting, leisure, hotel and heritage spaces are at the core of this vision.\\nWhile improvements to transportation may provide benefits to the populace, these redevelopments only offer hope for increased tourist dollars and a small number of low-paying jobs. One example is the Estádio Mario Filho (better known as the Maracanã) stadium in Rio, which underwent more than $500m in renovations ahead of the 2014 World Cup. Once cast in the populist light of the 1950s to communicate ideas of democracy, it now aims to attract a different kind of person: the consumption-oriented international tourist.\\nOne of the central challenges of hosting any mega-event is what to do with the new infrastructure after the athletes and tourists have gone. Some host cities – such as Barcelona – have made good use of their stadia, but others are replete with white elephants. Montreal, Sydney, Athens, Beijing and Vancouver have all had their share of post-olympics venue failures .\\nThe 2010 World Cup in South Africa offers a particularly stark warning: the stadia continue to rot from disuse . And Brazil appears destined to repeat the same mistakes, as the country struggles to find a purpose for its 2014 World Cup facilities. White elephants are highly-visible reminders that mega-events may not be worth the cost. But there’s an even more insidious side-effect which is often overlooked.\\n3. Human rights violations\\nBuilding new infrastructure in a city means destroying established urban areas. When that happens, local populations and communities are often dispersed and displaced.\\nTo make way for Beijing’s 2008 Olympic infrastructure, an estimated 1.5m people were forcibly evicted from their homes with minimal compensation. The neighbourhoods were destroyed and residents removed to the outskirts of the city far from friends, family and places of work.\\nNot sports fans, we assume.\\xa0Image: Krus Krug/Flickr/creative commons.\\nIn Rio, the forced eviction process has taken on a militarised ethos, as Police Pacification Units (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora) try to control a number of the city’s favelas. Demolition, displacement and the razing of Unesco world heritage sites all feature in preparations for the games.\\nRepressive measures within China and Tibet at the 2008 games, LGBT rights issues surrounding the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi and casualties on construction sites for the Qatar 2022 World Cup all point toward the persistent human rights issues which all too often accompany mega-events. Rather than representing unity and diversity, it seems as though the Olympic Games have started to signify oppression and exclusion.\\n4. Fear and security\\nIn many host cities, publicly-funded yet privately-owned urban renewal projects have been leveraged to impose enhanced surveillance measures. For instance, London 2012 saw the rise of “defensible” architecture , which restricts the access and activities of those deemed “undesirable” – particularly skateboarders, protesters and the homeless – in newly-developed areas.\\nLondon’s Strand East Community – developed by Vastint Holding, IKEA’s holding company for residential development, ahead of the 2012 Olympics – is characteristic of the city’s propensity towards “enclave living”. This means a high security presence, which accepts those with the capital to invest, and rejects those who are deemed a threat to the safety and security of its residents. Such projects have caused urban spaces to be splintered. Those who lack the desire or means to engage with the consumer economy are stigmatised as “unwanted”.\\nLondon looking welcoming. Image: diamond geezer/Flickr/creative commons.\\nThis process of securitisation has been fuelled by fear of attacks on popular sporting events, such as the bombing of the 2013 Boston Marathon and the targeting of Paris’ Stade de France in November 2015. Planning committees have been burdened with the impossible task of preventing such attacks, by building security into the infrastructure, planning, organisation and practices associated with mega-events.\\n5. International prestige\\nHosting a mega-event can create buzz, offer the chance for a positive re-brand or garner international prestige. But it can also draw unwanted attention and bad press. Host nations often obscure human rights violations, but will find it more difficult to manage the high-profile political and economic problems associated with international organisations like the IOC. For example, political scandals have recently tarnished the reputations of sporting bodies such as FIFA and the IAAF .\\nBy being more aware of the potential pitfalls of hosting mega-events, residents are in a better position to engage with the bidding process – or to resist it, like those involved in the “No Boston Olympics” campaign . Instead of grasping at opportunities to host the Olympics, city authorities are getting better at considering how the games actually fit with their priorities – or if they do at all. This can only be a good thing.\\nBryan C.

From the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff to the rapid spread of the fearful Zika virus, events in Brazil have provided a worrying backdrop to the games, which start next week.\\nIt’s tempting for Londoners to look back at the games four years ago as a golden age, when we got to show off our modern metropolis, not to mention our cultural superiority, in that stunning open ceremony.\\nBut we should try looking at the games in a different light. By looking at the benefits they bring to host cities, in terms of long-term investment in infrastructure and public transport, we can ask ourselves a trickier question. How good were London’s games, really? Might Rio outperform us?\\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2016\\nRio’s Maracana Stadium, February 2015. Image: Getty.\\nThere’s no doubt that Rio is set to benefit from enormous investment in its transport network in preparation for the games. Current estimates put the total expenditure on public transport investment at 24 billion reals, or around £5.5bn; though it’s highly possible that this figure could rise in the coming years and months, as final costs are totted up.\\nOne of the main regeneration projects associated with the games is the Porto Maravilha (literally: “Marvellous Port”), a stretch of the bay-front near Rio’s city centre that has seen a complete overhaul of day-to-day urban infrastructure like sewage systems to water pipes. The development has also seen 11 miles of cycle paths built, 18.6 miles of light rail laid down, and a huge highway flyover demolished.\\nSeperately, the city has also opened a new tram line, running from Santos Dumont Airport, the city’s second major hub, to the bus terminal of Rodoviaria Novo Rio near the city centre.\\nThe good news goes thus far but no further.\\nA planned metro extension, running from the renowned beach-hugging suburb of Ipanema (tall and tan and yes you know the rest), through super-rich playground Leblon to the Olympic Village in Barra da Tijuca, has been hit by delays and budget overruns.\\nIts original cost was estimated at 5 billion Brazilian reals (£1.2bn); but in the course of building it, its price has almost doubled to 9.7 billion. We still don’t have a final figure for how much the project has cost.\\nTo top it all off, it’s not even opening properly before the games start. Back in May, the city said it would be ready to go on 1 August, which is just four days before the opening ceremony. Even then, the service won’t be open properly. For the first two months, Metro 4 line will be available only to those connected to the games: officials, competitors, or spectators with tickets.\\nAfter the Paralympic Games wrap up in September, the service will be opened to the public, with a slow increase in the regularity of service until eventually (at some unspecified date) it’ll be running at the kind of level you’d expect from a metro.\\nLondon, UK, 2012\\nLondon’s Olympic Park, shortly before the games in 2012. Image: Getty.\\nNot too fast, there, Londoners. I see you, smugly sipping your coffee as you replay the 2012 Opening Ceremony video for the umpteenth time with a borderline-patriotic tear trickling down your metropolitan cheek. We didn’t do such a great job of all things transport either. Indeed, if you think about it: what did we do?\\nTransport for London did extend the East London line of the London Overground was extended, connecting Highbury & Islington in the north, to West Croydon, Crystal Palace, and New Cross in the south.\\nBut to be honest, it didn’t have that much to do with the Olympics. It was given the go-ahead in 2001 before Tony Blair had even vaguely considered jet-setting to Singapore to clinch host city status as a vague way of patching up his bleak third term in office. And it doesn’t even go to Stratford.\\nSome tweaks were made to the Docklands Light Railway, adding more carriages to services, and… no, wait, that’s the lot.\\nThe games did see the launch of a loudly-trumpeted new high-speed service, triumphantly titled “the Javelin”, connecting St Pancras to the misleadingly named Stratford International station. No international services, Eurostar or otherwise, stopped at Stratford International for the duration of the games, or indeed since. On the plus side, you could get to Kent really quickly, which is always nice.\\nOne of the biggest transport investments for the 2012 London Olympic Games – the clue apparently not being in the name – was in Dorset.\\nWeymouth Bay was chosen as the location for all the sailing events of the games, but it was already known that in the summer months roads in the area became heavily congested with all the additional tourist traffic. Rather than moving the sailing to another location, the organizers of the games decide to spend £77m (to possibly £89m; it depends who you believe) at Dorset to build a great big relief road to make everyone happy.\\nAnd, of course, how could we forget the cable car. Estimated to have cost £60m, the cable car’s lack of utility is a thing of great renown to all in the capital. Reports circulated that it had just four regular commuters, which has since become no regular commuters . The parody twitter account Emirate Dangleway really says everything you need to know about London’s great Olympic adventure:\\nhi London i am still here #tubealerts\\n🙁\\n— EmirateDangleway (@Dangleway) June 9, 2016\\nThese tweets could make a grown man cry.\\nRio’s games, opening next Friday, will be an interesting test of how a nation under such intense political and cultural pressure copes with the eyes of the world watching.\\nThere is no doubt that there will be hiccups, and its legacy will be intensely divisive. But in time cariocas will be able to ride their extended metro, hop on a new tram, cycle along a new cycle path, and explore an area released from a tyrannical flyover, safe in the knowledge that an investment has been made in their city and its transport.\\nLondoners can only hop on the Dangleway sporting a “I hosted the Olympics and all I got was this lousy cable car” T-shirt, and hope that being ironic will make the pain go away.\\nWant more of this stuff?

With the benefit of hindsight, many are surveying the city with a critical eye, wondering whether the multi-billion dollar mega-event was worth it.\\nWhen a city is graced by the pinnacle of cultural and sporting celebration that is the Olympic Games, it also carries out a programme of ambitious urban development: from short-term regeneration to longer-term infrastructure works. Since the start of the century, such non-sporting outcomes have become a major part of the bidding process for would-be host cities.\\nToday, a bid to host the Olympics can provide a powerful political will for change, pool public and private money together in enormous funds, and catalyse urban development at an astounding rate.\\nMixed visions\\nYet event-led policies are complex. They cut across many different locations, affecting communities and businesses in myriad ways. Competing interests must be prioritised, and those with money and power are often better able to influence outcomes to their advantage than poorer, less “visible” residents.\\nRio’s favelas offer a case in point. Around 23-24 per cent of the city’s population live in informal or slum housing, and many were hit with forced evictions to make way for sports facilities or transport routes. One civil society group calculated that 22,059 families were evicted across the city ahead of mega-events between 2009 and 2015 – that’s approximately 77,206 people .\\nHere we find that mega-events escape from the confines of democratic planning, and avoid the progressive, plural and consultative processes typically found as part of the “normal” governance of daily life. Scholars have observed that, during the planning and delivery periods, host cities symbolise “Olympic states of exception” , wherein urban policies are fast-tracked to deliver the infrastructure in time for the games.\\nThe vision for Rio’s Olympic legacy drew a mixed response before the games even began, so now that they’re over, the city is in for some heavy scrutiny. To even the most optimistic eye, it’s clear that in places, reality falls far short of the dream.\\n\\xa0\\nA post shared by Victor Den Heijer (@victordenheijer) on\\nFeb 20, 2017 at 3:58am PST\\nVenues remain without owners, part-functioning or in complete disarray . They are transforming into text-book examples of “white elephants”; flashy developments built for show, which fall out of use and become a burden on public funds once the party is over. For the residents of a city which was already struggling in the grips of economic, political and health crises , this must be especially frustrating.\\nA ray of hope\\nBut while the physical remnants of the games are withering, the cultural legacy of Rio’s Porto Maravilha shines bright. Before being made-over for the games , the area had a reputation for being unsafe: abandoned buildings were blemished by broken windows, and locals avoided walking there after dark.\\nBut now, six months on, it’s the place to be: throngs of people can be seen cycling or strutting across what was the largest ever “ live site ” in Olympic history. The Porto Maravilha has become a cultural hub, where locals and visitors gather to eat local street food and soak up the sights, which include attractions such as My Porto Maravilha and one of the world’s largest murals .\\nOf course, this kind of urban make-over can have unintended consequences. Gentrification occurs when major structural and economic changes force lower income communities out of an area, and it’s one of the biggest challenges faced by Olympic host cities, past and future.\\nIn the case of the Barcelona 1992 games, it was found that gentrification “ changed the social mix ” of local communities and caused house prices to jump 250 per cent between 1986 and the start of the games. Similarly, since the Olympic park was constructed for London 2012, the thriving community of artists in nearby Hackney Wick has been threatened with displacement.\\nRegeneration is a two-sided coin : it can raise the standards of living for local residents – or progressively drive them out entirely. The risk is that every time Olympic developments price out locals by driving up housing costs, it makes the prospect of hosting the Olympics a little less attractive .\\nThe truth is, much of the story of Rio’s Olympic legacy has yet to be written, and what counts as a win to some may feel like a sore loss to others. There will be businesses that continue to ride the wave of trade after the event, while creatives capitalise on the port’s new cultural scene. But there will also be poorer, more vulnerable residents struggling to find and settle into new homes. Perhaps the best way to judge is to visit and see for yourself.\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

Here’s her view of the games and their legacy.\\nNo sooner had the 2016 Olympic Games finished than commentators were lamenting their negative impacts on the host city, Rio de Janeiro. Many have concluded that a sustainable Olympic legacy is either uncertain, or downright impossible.\\nBut while these tales of doom and gloom make for dramatic headlines, the reality is not so grim.\\nThe international press have always been pessimistic about Brazil’s ability to stage the Olympics. Before the games began, a steady flow of articles critiqued the preparations , condemned forced evictions and cast doubt on whether vital infrastructure would be delivered on schedule. Admittedly, in the context of the ongoing economic crisis and political turmoil, there was – and still is – good cause for concern. But it is important not to get fixed on controversies as the only source of truth.\\nOnce the games started, the city was given a short break and the focus moved to the wonders of sport – and obsessive medal counting. But after many were swept up in the thrill of the games themselves, it didn’t take long for the criticisms to return .\\nIn contrast with this bleak picture, my own research on Rio throughout the games fortnight, building on a framework that interrogates the cultural dimensions of this as well as eight previous host cities since Sydney 2000, reveal a different dimension of the Olympic city this summer.\\nThe art of progress\\nThe people I spoke to were frustrated that uplifting stories about the urban, social and cultural changes taking place in Rio were not being picked up by journalists. This was especially clear in Rio’s favelas , where I conducted the bulk of my research. These informal slum-like settlements span across the city’s hills and have attracted worldwide attention for their poor living conditions and the high crime rates, associated with drug dealing.\\nWhile internal gang wars have resulted in targeted violence for decades, favela residents insist they are also part of strong and optimistic communities. Those outside of gang rivalries say that they feel safe and well supported within their neighbourhood, and that culture and creativity has always been a source of empowerment .\\nDJ Zezinho speaks to a Russian TV crew about his work as community DJ in Rocinha. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nIn particular, cultural activists working in the favelas, such as DJ Zezinho and Obi Wan, told me that they were fed up with being asked to talk about everything that is wrong in Rio. They said that their community life is thriving and opportunities are opening up for residents like Obi Wan, who got a grant to study at a private school and is now running a popular youth hostel and favela tours .\\nArtists (both home-bred and adopted) are also bringing about positive changes to their neighbourhoods. The International Olympic Committee’s first artist-in-residence – photographer and street artist JR – has taken a prominent role in a number of projects at the Olympic Games.\\nJR’s InsideOut. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nHis work ranges from the monumental Giants to portraits of Olympic participants ( InsideOut ), to small, community-focused interventions – such as a cultural centre, Casa Amarela , based in one of Rio’s oldest favelas.\\nWhat’s more, the first favela-based libraries are opening up, and the new Olympic metro line will improve accessibility to Rio’s most prominent favela, Rocinha. Residents are hopeful that this will finally make it plain that favelas are truly a part of Rio – they weren’t even recognised on official maps until 2013 .\\nLocal entrepreneur Obi Wan speaks in front of Rocinha graffiti sensation Wark, whose work is spread throughout Rio and internationally. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nOf course, locals’ reactions to the Olympics aren’t all positive. One Rocinha resident pointed out: “We are not allowed to use the metro until after the games – at the moment, only Olympic competition ticket holders can.” But in the wake of extensive drug lord removals and pacification – a controversial but transformative effort to fight crime in the favelas, which was accelerated as the Olympics were looming – no one denies that the big event has helped advance important social causes and address essential public infrastructure needs.\\nIt’s not just residents of the favelas who are feeling some benefits from hosting the games. Despite Rio’s reputation for being a city of great inequality , it does actually have a substantial middle class. Between 60 per cent\\xa0and 75 \\xa0per cent\\xa0of its population live in four large districts: the historic, downtown Centro, the flashy Zona Sul, the largely low-income, residential Zona Norte and the suburbs of the west side.\\nThe latter includes Barra da Tijuca – the site of the main Olympic Park, which is rapidly developing as new, more wealthy communities move in. The Olympic Games have given Rio’s middle-class residents – particularly those in Centro and Zona Norte – a chance to participate in the debate around the kind of city Rio is, and could be.\\nNo-go to must-go\\nBoth city and Olympic officials have made much of the claim that 63 per cent\\xa0of the population now have access to public transport (up from 18 per cent, seven years ago). But an equally important (and, culturally, more significant) Olympic legacy for Rio is the rediscovery of its public spaces, as areas for people to meet and mingle.\\nThe Olympic Boulevard in Porto Maravilhas was the most popular site for collective (unticketed) celebration during the games. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nJust as Barcelona rediscovered its port during the 1992 Olympics, Rio has reconnected with the long-derelict Porto Maravilhas. The Porto borders downtown Centro, an area which bustles with office workers from all across the city during the week.\\nBut up until recently, Centro lacked public meeting spaces, and was considered an unsafe, no-go area in the evenings and on weekends. This has changed dramatically for the duration of the Olympic Games (and carrying on into the Paralympics). Porto Maravilhas has been rebranded as the Boulevard Olimpico – and suddenly, it’s the place to be.\\nA dedicated Olympic “live site”, where fans can watch the action on big screens, the Boulevard Olimpico owes its success to the ingenious combination of a diverse cultural offering (including the new Museum of Tomorrow and the revamped Museum of Art in Rio ) with business displays and entertainment.\\nHuge works from Kobra has encouraged other artists to work in the area. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nWhat’s more, the thoughtful way the space has been used sparked a flurry of street artists (five so far, and counting) to take over old warehouse walls and produce enormous graffiti artworks.\\nAnd this is only the second time – after Vancouver’s Winter Olympics in 2010 – that an Olympic Cauldron was placed outside the sports venue, giving those without tickets the chance to experience one the most recognisable Olympic icons first hand.\\nThe eco-friendly Olympic Cauldron has become one of Rio’s favourite sites for selfies. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nSo, Cariocas have flocked in their thousands to the Boulevard Olympico. They have fully embraced this new part of their city: there will be no white elephants here. The port has passed from no-go to must-go area in a matter of months and, given its position as meeting point for daily commuters, it is set to become one of the most lively and diverse public places in the city.\\nA lasting legacy\\nThe Parque Madureira, in the northern part of the city, is another example of urban regeneration leaving a positive legacy for the local community. Located in a densely populated, low-income area, which is dominated by factory infrastructure, this new park has brought greenery, sporting facilities and new cultural life to a neighbourhood of more than 350,000 people.\\nThe largest set of Olympic rings are placed at Madureira park, in low-income Zona Norte. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nRio is a big city. With Olympic activities dotted across the four main districts, hardcore sports fans have been forced to spend a considerable part of their day in transit. Because of this, visitors have been exposed to the many sides of Rio, beyond the sandy beaches in Copacabana and the dirty streets in the slums.\\nAbove all else, the games have showcased the generous spirit of the Carioca. While in Rio, I witnessed the locals’ thrill at discovering new spaces to gather, exercise and party; their enjoyment and surprise at mixing with people from other districts – often, for the first time, given the city’s longstanding north-south economic divide, and their refusal to be confined by stereotypes and condemned to repeat the same social and cultural mistakes.\\nThere are hard times ahead; the country still faces an ongoing recession and political turmoil. But the Olympic Games have opened up new public spaces, giving everyone the chance to generate positive collective memories – with the Paralympics yet to come. Rather than taking on a defeatist, “can’t-do” attitude, there is much to be gained by paying attention to what’s gone right in Rio.\\nBeatriz Garcia \\xa0is head of research and cultural policy at the\\xa0Institute of Cultural Capital, University of Liverpool .\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

Will these games, like so many other games in recent memory, transcend the well-publicised problems of the lead-up and provide a spectacle so successful that we will forget about all the problems?\\nOr will the deep-seated problems reinforce an emerging counternarrative: that the games are a spectacular misuse of money run by an outdated organisation devoted to its own self-enrichment and a flawed model of sports events moving inexorably to failure and ignominy?\\nRio may well be the landmark games of this new narrative frame.\\nGreater scrutiny\\nThere have been Summer Olympic Games every year since 1896, apart from 1916, 1940 and 1944, canceled because of war. Over the years the Olympic Games have gotten bigger and more global. In 1896, only 241 participants competed from 14 countries. In 2012, there were 10,769 athletes from 205 countries competing in London .\\nOnly two landmark games fundamentally changed how the Olympics were perceived and produced.\\nBerlin in 1936 marked the beginnings of the games as a global production. The Nazis, always intensely aware of the power and significance of spectacle, gave the 1936 Olympic Games the first multimedia coverage with television transmission, shortwave radio broadcasts and an official movie. The in-house Nazi cinematographer, the immensely gifted Leni Riefenstahl, paid homage to the physicality of the event in the film “Olympia,” which was released in 1938 .\\nThe 1936 Berlin Olympics, captured in the Leni Reifenstahl film “Olympia,” marked the first globally broadcast games.\\nThe 1984 Los Angeles games, organized after the financial disaster of Montreal in 1976 , marked the collapse of the old funding model and inaugurated the corporatisation of the games, when\\xa0the local organising committee signed up 34 commercial corporate sponsors. Corporate sponsorship along with broadcasting rights now provide a steady flow of money into the IOC coffers .\\nThese two landmark games heralded the start of global media coverage in Berlin and corporate sponsorship of the games in Los Angeles. But the increasing size of the games and the vast global coverage has also created structural problems.\\nAs the Rio Olympic Games opened, a number of these problems were particularly resonant.\\nFlawed business model\\nInequity. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), first established in 1894, was always organised along elitist lines with a lack of transparency and accountability .\\nIt was headquartered in Switzerland to avoid any form of national regulation. The early members were rich, titled or well-connected – preferably all three. Today members of the IOC include Crown Prince Frederic of Denmark, Princess Anne of UK, Prince Albert of Monaco, Sheik Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah of Kuwait, and let’s not forget the Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Princess Nora of Liechtenstein.\\nThe IOC’s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. Image: diluvienne/flickr/creative commons.\\nLittle attention was paid to the needs or requirements of the athletes. The IOC was consciously insulated from any electoral process or effective control by athletes – and yet this committee was and remains the principal governing body of the Olympic Games. Each member gets to travel first-class around the world, and receives between $400 and $900 per diem .\\nIn Beijing, special lanes whisked IOC members in chauffeur-driven luxury rides through the traffic jams. Meanwhile the actual athletes live in more cramped conditions and get paid very little .\\nIn other words, IOC members lead a luxurious lifestyle funded on the backs of superb athletes who receive only a small share of the proceeds.\\nIn the run-up to the games in Rio, we have heard stories of athletes swimming in polluted waters and living in substandard accommodations . Meanwhile, IOC members continue with their luxurious subsidised lifestyle.\\nWorst-case scenario\\nMixed impact on cities. The IOC often touts hosting the Olympics as a force for good, and there are the positive examples of Barcelona and Sydney. But for many cities, hosting the Olympic Games means taking on expensive projects where the costs are always underestimated, the benefits always overestimated and the legacy is obsolete athletic venues.\\nRio presents the worst-case scenario of costly overruns and inadequate infrastructure .\\xa0As money is spent on the two-week event, slum dwellers are evicted and basic services for the majority in the city, such as adequate sewerage, remain unfulfilled. When land is cleared for a golf course, a minority sport in the country played only by a tiny elite, we are not in the realm of progressive urban redevelopment.\\nThe large-scale eviction of close to half a million people in Beijing revealed the human costs. But Brazil is a more open society than China, so we can expect a more open discussion of a lavish global spectacle hosted in city where many people are poor and will remain poor after the Olympics.\\nDoping. Then, there is the doping scandal that will mar this year’s games.\\nAthletes have been taking performance-enhancing drugs since the first Olympic Games in ancient Greece. But the industrial scale of doping by the Russian team raises serious questions about the commitment of the IOC to drug testing and proper punishment . With most of the Russian track and field team now banned, will Rio be the stage for a serious discussion of doping and drugs in the Olympic Games? And will the pervasive nature of drug-taking and limited drug-testing mean we have to assume people have won the medals only temporarily until proven innocent of drug-taking?\\nRising costs. As the games become bigger, adding new sports and extending the number of competitors, the costs mount .\\nBut the IOC model is to make the cities cover all the costs and take all the risks, while they control the revenue. The IOC maintains this power though the bidding process whereby cities have to compete to host the games. The arrangement favors the IOC as it forces cities to try to outdo each other .\\nBut there is beginning to be a backlash. The Winter Olympics of 2022 will take place in Beijing because Norway pulled out of the bidding process and refused the IOC demands. And the US\\xa0Olympic Committee pulled Boston as a US\\xa0bid city because of fierce resistance from residents .\\nA force for good?\\nCorruption. There is the mounting evidence of continuing corruption in the IOC . In particular, the bidding process, as cities compete to host the next Olympic Games and IOC members get to vote for the host city, is increasingly prone to corruption as some IOC members turn their votes into hard cash, soft benefits and endless freebies.\\nThe IOC has long promoted itself as a force for good. Its promotion of greener games is now undermined in the case of Rio, with waters polluted by raw sewage.\\nCities where there is a democratic discussion are unlikely to host the games if the real costs and benefits are made public. The result is a growing use of sites in authoritarian and totalitarian countries. With every Beijing and Sochi, the connection between the Olympics and social progress is undermined by the games’ association with community displacement, environmental destruction, abuse of workers and transgression of human rights. Cities in China are now favored hosts for the Olympics as they deliver spectacular games without any public resistance.\\nThe IOC charter claims to promote\\xa0fundamental ethical principles,\\xa0but in practice it has turned arguably the gold of our love of sports, great athletic achievements and stirring competition into the dross of a bloated, corrupt, money-making machine, devoted to a lavish lifestyle funded by public companies and media conglomerates, based on the skills of underpaid athletes and condoned by a watching public.\\nWe love the games, but is that enough for us to overlook the malfeasance of a deeply flawed organisation that is running out of legitimacy and relevance? What will we take away from the next two weeks and beyond: the gold or the dross?\\nJohn Rennie Short is a professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. \\xa0This article was originally published on The Conversation .

Calgary is the latest city to suffer the indignity of a proposed Olympic bid being scuppered by a public referendum. And how we – or at least those of us who don’t work in Olympic sport – love it when the Olympics and the IOC get a bloody nose.\\n“Nobody can afford to host the Olympics but at the IOC the largesse never stops”, read a gleeful headline from the\\xa0Guardian, actually published a couple of weeks before the vote, nicely summed up the prevailing (western) attitude to the Olympics, for those without any skin in the game(s).\\nWritten by someone, calling himself an ‘unlucky sucker’, who claims to love the Olympics, it continues: “Potential host cities are dwindling to an embarrassing low and yet the International Olympic Committee seems to still be living in the era when money is no object”. With friends like that…\\xa0\\nPartly, as we all know, the IOC doesn’t help itself. Covering the Olympic movement, you can’t help but come close to gagging on the sickly-sweet diet of first-class air travel, luxury limos, opulent hotel suites and exclusive dinners that constitutes life inside the bubble of IOC membership.\\nIndeed, the Guardian article didn’t fail to recycle the (probably fallacious) story that the IOC’s ‘rider’ for hosting the 2022 winter Olympics in Oslo (which subsequently dropped out of the race) was 7,000 pages long and stipulated that IOC members get a cocktail reception with the Norwegian royal family, exclusive use of special road lanes and priority treatment at airports and hotels, “but stopped just short of Van Halen’s famous request for a bowl of M&Ms with all the brown ones picked out.”\\nI have interviewed a series of IOC members and those close to the IOC in recent months and years and can’t help feeling that they, or many of them, still don’t get it. Often, they seem genuinely hurt and baffled when asked what the IOC can do to reverse the received wisdom (recycled again and again by the world’s media) that its members are out of touch and over-entitled and that the games are elitist and just, somehow, neither of, nor for, the people.\\nThis is despite the fact that a millionaire Olympian is, on the whole, an oxymoron, while a millionaire in football, the ‘people’s’ game, is just the football billionaire’s poor relation (yes, I know football is in the Olympics, but it’s telling that it’s an under-23 tournament and the stars don’t take part – they know they can earn much, much more with their clubs).\\nFor, like it or not, the reason that cities keep dropping out of Olympic bid races is money. Just consider the Calgary bid campaign, which seemed absolutely incapable of derailing the runaway juggernaut of public debate from the preordained tramlines of ‘think-how-many-schools-and-hospitals you-could-get-for that-amount-of-money’ that the ‘NOlympics’ lobby had laid down for it.\\nYet show me, if you can, all the schools and hospitals that the nine cities and states that have rejected the Olympics in referenda in the last five years have built with the money they saved. You can’t? Thought not.\\nThe point about the Olympic Games, if they’re done well, is that they’re not a cost; they’re an investment. Just take a look at the post-industrial wasteland that was the east end of London before the 2012 games, and then look at it now. The UK government knew this (or at least it was eventually brought round to believing it), which was why it went ahead with the games without feeling the need to call a referendum.\\nIt’s true that costs multiplied over the course of the bid process, and that the eventual all-in cost of approximately £9bn ($11.6bn) was several times the amount originally forecast. But that’s not £9bn to host an Olympic Games, it’s £9bn to regenerate a massive area of one of the world’s great cities – transport, infrastructure, housing, sports facilities for all and, yes, even a school.\\nAnd, hey, you know what? The costs of major infrastructure projects nearly always do overrun. A recent report found that cost and revenue overruns of Olympic Games between 2000 and 2018 are broadly comparable to those of other similar large-scale projects.\\nThe study, by academics at Germany’s Johannes Gutenberg University and France’s Paris Panthéon Sorbonne, found that: “The core Olympic capital investments considered in this study show cost overruns, but they are similar to the cost overruns of other (non-sporting) mega projects.”\\nMoreover, the study also found that “All Games underestimated their revenues and had revenue overruns,” and that “the costs of organising the Olympic Games (OCOG budget) are usually covered by revenues, which are almost entirely private resources plus the International Olympic Committee’s contribution.”\\nCalgary’s budget for hosting the winter Olympic Games, including delivery and games operations, all venues, housing, legacy endowment and contingency funds, was a relatively modest C$5.1bn ($3.9 bn) in C$2018. That’s still a lot of money, some might say, but a lot of money compared to what? Canada’s federal budget for 2018-19 is C$338.5bn – and remember that’s for just one year. The costs of hosting the games would have been spread over seven years.\\nBack in the UK, it’s now six years since those £9bn games, and the government’s current pet project is ‘HS2’, a high-speed rail line linking London, Birmingham, the East Midlands, Leeds and Manchester. Scheduled to open in phases between 2026 and 2033, high-speed trains will travel at up to 400 kilometres an hour on 330 miles of track.\\nSounds expensive? It is.

He has cleaned out his desk and moved on to bigger and better things.\\nBut Johnson got London’s housing badly wrong – and it is worth reflecting on the reasons why he presided over the rise and rise of the capital’s biggest crisis. Why, on his watch, did housing become the domain purely of the big guys with their overblown solutions? Why is the cupboard bare? Has it all been one big bodge?\\nTo be fair, it was the previous mayor, Ken Livingstone, who created the trend for mega-development, in effect telling developers (I paraphrase), “I don’t care how big it is, as long as 50 per cent is mine for social and affordable housing.”\\nLivingstone policy shifted social housing from a failing utopian model, to the sidelines of a booming real estate market. The standard investment-led, one- and two-bedroom apartment block was born at a time when money was cheap. Space standards plummeted; urban quality collapsed. We saw the emergence of a foot-loose community with little commitment to place: housing had been reduced to a commodity. \\xa0\\nWhen Boris came to power, the Ken model had collapsed under the weight of the global banking crisis. But, as we found out later, the banks – and the big housebuilders they were in bed with – were too big to collapse. For the new mayor’s housing policy, this meant one thing: drop the social and affordable housing requirement and plough on. London needs housing. Keep building. The big guys know best.\\nBoris, as mayor, was born into this complex and changing world. But he cannot escape the blame for what happened next. He could have made a big difference. He had the Olympics legacy and big chunks of land to do something with. He had the energy and creativity of the capital in his favour. People were looking for something new: he had a mandate to develop a new London way of doing things.\\nHe promised change. And his words in the London Housing Design Guide suggested bold ambitions:\\nWe are building places to live in a city with unique character, with examples of great housing and city-making at a range of densities. London’s terraced houses, apartment buildings, streets, squares and the best of 20th century development have created highly successful residential environments with enduring appeal.\\nMy housing strategy aspires to encourage a new London vernacular that can take its place in this rich fabric.\\nYet what followed was a catalogue of errors – or, at best, serious misjudgements. Here are 10.\\n1) Boris appointed his chum, Richard Blakeway, as his deputy mayor for housing. An international policy wonk, Blakeway knew nothing about delivering housing in the capital, so was a very strange appointment for such a crucial role in London. Boris allowed him to bungle along for his entire term, making all the right noises, but achieving little.\\nJust compare him with Martin Muller, the former deputy mayor for Berlin, who led on such game-changing housing projects as Self-Made City and the Berlin Townhouse project. Blakeway was a disaster for London.\\n2) Boris surprisingly retained many of the top city officials who blissfully continued in their role as box-checkers and bean counters at a time when we needed enlightened thinking and action. Some of them were at the birth of London’s housing crisis, helping with its delivery.\\nThis group saw no way forward other than getting the big guys to solve their problems. Vast chunks of London’s housing estates were parcelled up to the big few. There was no imagination, no willingness to try anything different and no desire to allow others to do so. They protected their patch and defended against change. Much of the blame can be laid at their feet.\\n3) Shortly after he arrived, Boris abolished Design for London. The agency’s head, Peter Bishop – London’s best shot of having a city architect again – was banished to the far-flung reaches of his London Development Agency. Here was one of London’s most valuable assets being wasted for political reasons. What was left behind was a band of amateurs with little experience of being at the coalface of housing.\\n4) The mayor’s housing guide, originally been commissioned by Ken and led by the Head of Design for London, was intended to be a comprehensive neighbourhood design guide showing the London Way of doing things. But under this team of box-checkers, bean counters and amateurs, it became little more than an uninspiring space standards manual that missed the whole point: another wasted opportunity.\\n5) Boris and his team dallied with self-build, community housing trusts and new family housing models but nothing ever got off the ground. More complex policies were written; more unrealisable targets were set; more bold and brave announcements followed. More opportunity sites were declared, more big masterplans with even greater unrealistic expectations held London to ransom. More hearts sunk.\\n6) Boris sold the best bits of land to others. The Chinese got the Royal Docks, one of London’s best opportunity sites. The Qatari Development Agency got a big chunk of the Olympic Village; the rest of the Olympic Legacy sites are being parcelled up to sell to the big players.\\nIt seemed that the only game in London was to parcel up big chunks, sell it to the big players and wait for them to deliver. When they didn’t, we sold them more or gave them more money.\\nWhy did Boris sell the family silver? Berlin has shown how smaller developers could deliver housing 40 per cent cheaper on land with the same relative value as London, by dealing directly with the end-users. So why didn’t Boris cut out the middle man and deliver smaller chunks of land to smaller players on land controlled by his authority?\\n7) When nothing happens, where does his team go to for advice? To those who have a vested interest in the status quo – the big developers and their mega-consultants. It was like the foxes and the weasels advising the farmer on pest control.\\nNew ideas for housing were invited. The big guys and their megaconsultants helped to judge them. The status remained quo.\\n8) Despite Boris’s calls for a new London vernacular, there is sheer lack of imagination about what London’s rich building fabric might be. The big guys are producing housing as large chunks of exclusive development, not as the smaller individual building blocks that normally make up our socially-diverse and inclusive neighbourhoods.\\nEvery scheme appears to be a victim of bigness. Every scheme calls for unique brand. Every scheme is a “Square”, a “Quarter”, a “Village. Nothing adds to London’s unique character. Nothing hangs together.\\n9) The housing crisis has spawned the growing trend of “beds-in-sheds” across London. In one way, this is symptomatic of creative people solving their own housing problems. In another, it is simply the exploitation of desperate tenants.\\nBoris never showed any leadership in dealing with this issue. He should have found a way of capturing this energy and allow for positive intensification of our sprawling suburbs.\\n10) Boris and his team have made some disastrous decisions on major schemes in the capital. He circumvented the local planning process to take the decision on the Mount Pleasant scheme, another monolithic development that will diminish the rich urban fabric of Clerkenwell.\\xa0 His shabby support for the megastructural Earls Court Project was yet another reflection of the fact that he was never committed to the ambitions he set out in his own guide.\\nCaught in a crisis fuelled by his own lack of leadership, anything became acceptable to show the numbers.\\nOur new mayor Sadiq Khan has a lot to sort out.

The Boris-bestowed Olympicolpolis and South Kensington’s Albertopolis illustrate the role that the capital’s cultural quarters can play both in shaping London at both a local and global level.\\nThe aim of Exhibition Road is in its name. Completed in the 1860s, the quarter was funded by the proceeds of the Great Exhibition of 1851, and designed by Prince Albert to showcase the best that London had to offer in terms of scientific, technological and cultural endeavor. With institutions laid out along a half mile stretch of road, Albertopolis was as much gallery as it is cultural quarter, allowing a visitor to stroll at leisure through this collection of London’s most well-known cultural and education institutions.\\xa0\\nThis ordered and regimental style stands in direct contrast to London’s South Bank, a space that is much more free-flowing, and which defiantly ignores the concept of a street grid. While the modernist style of the South Bank could not be more different to the quiet order of Exhibition Road, the historic connection between the two quarters is clear. The construction of South Bank was central to the 1951 Festival of Britain, which commemorated the centenary of the Great Exhibition, attracting some 8m visitors over the course of just five months.\\nOf course, London’s cultural offer cannot be understood solely in reference to these quarters. London’s cultural scene has thrived on the periphery of these cultural quarters, and in many instances, beyond the confines of major cultural institutions.\\xa0\\nThis is particularly true in the instance of the creation of art. Artists studios have typically mushroomed in the cheapest areas of London, from the halycon days of 1990s Shoreditch, to the warehouses of Hackney Wick. (These areas, too, are now too expensive for most artists.) Just as London’s arts hubs have shifted, so too have the roles of its cultural institutions. This means keeping up with the trend towards temporary exhibitions in flexible spaces, and the profound impact of technology on the way the arts are both produced and consumed.\\xa0\\nEarlier this week, the London Legacy Development Corporation released new images of Stratford Waterfront, part of the new cultural and education District situated in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. The district will bring together major cultural institutions and provide space for organisations of all sizes to collaborate and innovate.\\xa0\\nExhibition Road was designed to showcase the best of London’s institutions; the South Bank to do the same for technology, science, and design in the post-war period. What role will the new cultural and education district in the east play in London’s urban form, and in its cultural collective memory?\\xa0\\nFollowing the example set by Prince Albert, the site is home not only to cultural institutions, but some of outposts of educational institutions including Loughborough and UCL. It is hoped, however, that rather than simply locating next to one another, these institutions will communicate and collaborate.\\xa0\\nPerhaps most excitingly, this collaboration is happening at a time of academic and economic convergence, where the distinctions between making and engineering are blurred, and creativity is associated as much with technology as it is the arts. At a time when many artists struggle to rent studios, and when local authorities have reduced funding for cultural spaces and activities, this new district could provide both the motivation and the space for collaboration. \\xa0\\nThis process of collaboration is not necessarily one that comes naturally to all institutions. Being part of a quarter, or network, means recognising that brands can be developed as much in partnership as through solo endeavor. The success of this new district will depend on not only collaboration between new institutions, but engagement between newcomers and the existing cultural and creative ecosystem. Whether in the provision of affordable workspace and artist’s studios, or through the programming of events and meet-ups, it is vital that the district complements rather than compromises the existing success of east London’s tech and creative sectors.\\xa0\\nLondon’s art scene and heritage has a long history of enticing people to visit, work and live in the city. It is a crucial part of the city’s economy. That’s why these cultural districts – old and new – are essential to London’s success.\\xa0\\nKat Hanna is research manager at Centre for London.

England’s greatest architect envisioned a city of wide, intersecting boulevards with vistas and squares inspired by the renaissance layout of Paris.\\nCharles II was keen on the idea. But lack of funds to buy the land, and the insistence of the City merchants that they get back to business as soon as possible, rather than hang around while a new plan was devised, meant that the Square Mile was rebuilt largely to the old medieval plan.\\nThis pragmatic approach to planning has characterised much of the development of the capital ever since. England’s common law and a national distrust of grand plans have conspired to produce a system of creating pieces of city that come about as a result of argument and enquiry rather than from a vision of a desirable city.\\nWren’s abandoned plan. Image courtesy of the Design Museum.\\nAs London grew in the 18th and 19th century, so the existing surrounding settlements expanded until they formed a single and untidy metropolis. The aristocratic estates like Bedford, Grosvenor and Portman hired developers who laid out houses in streets and squares that followed a masterplan. This generated local areas of coherence, like the white stucco and Classical architecture of Belgravia and the red terracotta of Arts and Crafts Chelsea. This mixture of single owner developments and areas of variety of style and ownership is a key part of the London’s character – the “city of villages”.\\nToday one has to ask whether the pressures of growth, and of global finance, combined with cuts in planning resources, are creating places that are outgrowing these empirical methods. In the current London Plan, large scale development is proposed to take place in Opportunity Areas. Some of these come under a single development entity, like Argent’s King’s Cross and CapCo’s Earls Court. Others have multiple ownership, like Nine Elms and South Quay on the Isle of Dogs. The two mayoral development corporations, for the Olympic Legacy and Old Oak Common, create masterplans with developers delivering individual sites.\\nKing’s Cross is a good example of how masterplanning can work. The developers and their consultants produced a clear layout for the site, retaining areas of key heritage and providing locations and size of buildings with a mix of uses around the site. The plan was flexible enough to change as economic situation changed; based on a series of sound rules, it retained a level of coherence in scale and detail. The architects of individual buildings were given freedom in developing their own palette of materials and colour in order to create variety and interest.\\nBy contrast South Quay, not far from Canary Wharf on the DLR, is in multiple ownership. Each landowner jockeys for taller and taller buildings, with guidance arriving late in the day from the authorities when it seemed that the density of the area could exceed even that of Central Hong Kong. Although a master plan has now been developed, it gives no hint as to the overall form, the townscape, of this key part of the capital.\\nThis is in contrast to Canary Wharf next door, where today’s development is still recognisable in drawings made by the celebrated architectural illustrator Carlos Dinez as far back as 1984. The architecture has changed over time, but the shape of the development is pretty much as planned.\\nSo, in areas of multiple ownership how do we create plans that can adapt to changing circumstance, yet create new quarters that are also great places?\\nWhat is needed is a wholesale shift from the current reactive and regulatory planning system to one that is proactive, positive and creative. This was clearly stated in The Farrell Review, prepared for former culture minister Ed Vaizey, but fell on deaf ears in a Government committed to stripping out planning services in local authorities. Will Theresa May’s administration be any different?\\nThe NLA’s model of modern London.\\xa0\\nThe process of shaping the city in a way that is accessible to public and professional alike can be facilitated using 3D computer models which also allow the desired flexibility. The Corporation of London is already using virtual modelling to plan the layout of tall buildings in the City, and New London Architecture (NLA) has been pressing City Hall to adopt a London-wide version ever since the publication of the NLA’s first Tall Buildings Survey in 2014 which highlighted the new for a more coherent skyline strategy.\\nProviding a clearer idea of the shape of the future city will give greater certainty to developers and communities alike; it will reassure local people about what is going up in their backyard, will reduce land speculation and make development less of a gamble.\\nAs mayor Sadiq Khan writes his own version of the London Plan, he has the opportunity to say not just what the London of the future will contain, how many people it can accommodate and what sort of jobs they will do – he can give us an idea of what it is actually going to be like.\\nPeter Murray is chair of New London Architecture.\\n“Experiencing the city: What makes London work?” is part of the talks programme at 100% Design which has been curated by the Design Museum, taking place 21-14 September at London Olympia.\\xa0\\nAll images in this article apear\\xa0courtesy of NLA and the Design Museum.\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'Share on Facebook\\nThe first of a short series looking at different options for solving London’s housing problems.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn the debate about London’s housing shortage, “brownfield” is often talked of as if there were vast swathes of unused land waiting to be reclaimed. The truth is, almost all London’s land is already used for something – and changing its use is slow, expensive and hard.\\nBrownfield must deliver much of the housing London needs, but a\\xa0 new report \\xa0by Quod and homelessness charity\\xa0 Shelter\\xa0 finds that brownfield will not be enough – and urges the next mayor not to rule out other approaches.\\nClick to expand.\\nSo how is London’s land used?\\xa0About two-thirds of the developed land already has housing on it. Of the rest, most is used for transport (including 15,000 km of roads), town centres and vital urban infrastructure like schools and hospitals.\\nClick to expand.\\nThat leaves about 9 per cent of London, which is essentially “employment land”. This is used for\\xa0all sorts of things – light industry, distribution depots, leisure, retail warehouses, sewage works.\\nClick to expand.\\nTo build housing on this land means removing something else first. That can and should be done in many places – but it is slow, difficult and expensive. It may mean finding a new place for existing uses, decontaminating land, and building new stations or other infrastructure.\\nThis painstaking land-use change is happening in many places already – so what scope is there for more to be done?\\nAbout half of non-housing brownfield land that is currently in employment uses – the half that is most suitable for redevelopment – is already earmarked for change in the mayor’s “Opportunity Areas”. Tens of thousands of homes are being built in places such as Kings Cross, Stratford and Nine Elms. This is already part of London’s current land supply.\\nIf brownfield is to deliver more on top of these Opportunity Areas, some very difficult choices need to be made. Getting more out of brownfield is not an “easy option” – and if brownfield is our only option it is highly unlikely that London will be able to build enough new homes quickly enough.\\nThe history of successful brownfield developments in London – like Kings Cross or Vauxhall/Nine Elms/Battersea – is that it can take many decades to deliver, and may finally need major public investment in infrastructure.\\nWe can get more from brownfield, but it will not be quick and it will not be cheap. And we cannot expect it to deliver all the homes London so urgently needs. To fill\\xa0the current gap in delivery using brownfield alone would mean the equivalent of another Olympic Legacy sized scheme, every three months or so, on top of what we’re already building. Other options simply must not\\xa0be ruled out.\\nWe cannot carry on as we are and expect housing delivery to double. We have to change things if we want enough homes. The level of housebuilding we need now has only been (briefly) achieved twice in the past – once through major public investment in council housing, and once through major expansion on greenfield land.\\xa0\\nThroughout London’s history, the private sector has never built more than 18,000 homes a year on brownfield land. To meet the city’s housing needs, we have to consider other options.\\nTomorrow, we’ll look at one of those options: garden cities.\\nBarney Stringer is a director at regeneration consultancy Quod.

Giving a\\xa0 talk \\xa0in 2012, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro brimmed with the bubbly optimism that comes natural to Brazilians, and the relentless drive that comes natural to big city mayors. Speaking in English tinged with a Brazilian lilt, he assured the crowd, “You’re looking at the guy who has the best job in the world!”\\nSensing that his charm offensive had worked, Paes quickly shifted to a more emotional tone. “I really wanted to share you\\xa0[sic]\\xa0a very special moment in my life, and in the history of Rio,” he said. On cue, the massive screen behind him played a clip of the announcement of Rio de Janeiro as host of the 2016 Olympics, made three years earlier. As the announcement was made, the Brazilian contingent leapt out of their seats. Brazil’s then-president “Lula” da Silva and football legend Pelé hugged each other enthusiastically.\\nFor Paes, it was a dream come true. And despite brief moments of uncertainty, such as his remarks after the 2013 Brazil bus-fare uprising in which he\\xa0 expressed doubts \\xa0about the legacy of the World Cup and the Olympics, he has remained faithful to bringing that dream to life. But for many in his city, the Olympic vision looks a lot less rosy.\\xa0\\nIn preparation for Rio’s 2016 Olympics, as well as last year’s World Cup final, Paes worked alongside city officials and the state of Rio de Janeiro to draft an urban investment plan that would amount to a\\xa0 total of $16.6bn . Chief among these costs were the city’s “Porto Maravilha” shorefront improvement plan, and a plan to build an extensive bus rapid transit (BRT) network. Other schemes called for improvements in housing and basic services.\\nBut these plans quickly ran into difficulties. In many cases, those “difficulties” seemed to be poorer favela dwellers living a bit too close to stadiums or event venues, who the Rio government preferred to move out of the way before the cameras started rolling.\\nThe Maracana Olympic stadium under construction in Rio. Image: Getty.\\nThese issues began as far back as 2012. Alongside the land slated to become Rio’s Olympic Park, west of the city centre, an informal settlement known as Vila Autódromo became the target of eviction efforts by the Government. The\\xa0New York Times\\xa0reported that Paes’s government had\\xa0 paid $11m to two real estate developers \\xa0who had donated to his campaign to resettle the land; Paes’s government later cancelled the deal.\\nIn 2014, as the World Cup was about to begin,\\xa0 similar plans \\xa0were made throughout the city. And these plans continue. Last month, local news source Rio On Watch reported that evictions and\\xa0 demolitions had begun \\xa0in the favela Vila União de Curicica, near Vila Autódromo. The demolitions were planned so as to enable the construction of the new Transolímpica\\xa0 rapid bus system ; they were carried out despite an earlier agreement to reroute the planned western line of the system.\\nBut the problems go beyond favela evictions. In January, Rachel Glickhouse at Fusion reported that the city was\\xa0 falling far short of the contamination clean-up target \\xa0it had set itself. Due to a 95 per cent budget cut, city officials acknowledged that “the government would fail to reach its 2016 goal to clean the filthy Guanabara Bay by 80 percent before the games,” Glickhouse noted, before highlighting other sanitation issues such as excessive trash dumped in the bay and contaminated sand on Rio’s famous beaches.\\nEven Rio’s signature Olympics improvement project, the Porto Maravilha, is running into trouble. The project consists of converting an elevated freeway in Rio’s port zone into an underground tunnel, using the newly open space for pedestrians and streetcars. The freeway has now been demolished – but it remains to be seen whether the underground tunnels will open in time for the games.\\nIn addition, specialists question whether the residential developments planned as part of the project will ultimately be beneficial. Ephim Schluger, an urban specialist for the World Bank,\\xa0 told Bloomberg News \\xa0that the buildings of the new development “will not have the life of a city”. Others worry about inequality. In an\\xa0 interview with Jornal do Brasil , urban planner Humberto\\xa0Kzure-Cerquera worried that the project would “marginalize the poorest population” of the area and “create a social abyss”.\\nDead fish float in\\xa0Guanabara Bay, part of which is due to be the Olympic sailing venue.

In response to what was deemed to be poor preparation, the IOC appointed its own experts to Rio’s local organising committee.\\nCould Paes have foreseen all these issues when he took the stage at the TED talk back in 2012? Given the issues cities so often face when hosting the Olympics, it’s hard not to think so. And yet, the prestige of becoming an Olympic host city was enough for Paes to turn a blind eye to potential problems.\\nIn a cruel irony, the process also seems to have blinded him to one of the principles he stated so proudly back during his TED talk: to respect the slums. In that talk, he urged cities in countries like Brazil not to destroy their slums, but to incorporate them into the rest of the city.\\nIn some cases, Paes has delivered on this; the Complexo do Alemão favela is now connected to the city with an\\xa0 aerial cable car , and other Rio favelas enjoy new parks and urban amenities. But it’s hard to look at the clearance projects in Vila Autodromo or Vila União de Curicica and think of them as being effective “slum upgrading”.\\nWhen the opening ceremonies begin in Rio in 2016, viewers from around the world will probably be treated to the same spectacle they are every four years: torches, concerts, lots of athletes competing in sports some of us may not have even have heard of, perhaps a bit of cool drone footage of the “Christ the Redeemer” statue. What remains to be seen is whether residents of places like Vila Autódromo will be any better off than they are today.\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'Share on Facebook\\nVila Autódromo is a small favela perched on the edge of the Olympic Park developments in Rio de Janeiro. The official plan for the park ensures that there’s space for the community to keep living there, and Rio’s mayor, Eduardo Paes, promised that nobody would be forced to leave.\\nYet since Rio was awarded the right to host the games, many homes in the community have been destroyed to make space for construction works. In some cases, evictions have turned violent . In others, dwellings are demolished without warning – for example, one resident’s house was destroyed while she was at a doctor’s appointment. These evictions – and the protests and social movements they have incited – have formed the focus of my doctoral research.\\nThe favela sits on a beautiful lagoon in Rio’s fast-developing West Zone. It would make for prime real estate, fuelling speculation that the current residents are being evicted to free up the land for redevelopment.\\nPrime real estate. Image: Buda Mendes/Getty Sports.\\nPolitically speaking, it’s easy to evict these residents because of the stigma surrounding the favelas. I asked Theresa Williamson, executive director of the NGO Catalytic Communities , to explain\\xa0the impact of the public’s negative perceptions about favelas:\\n[It] gives policy makers a pretext to do whatever they want. If you think favelas are violent by nature, you’re going to think any policing is good policing. If you think favelas are precarious, horrible places to live, then you’re going to think any public housing is good housing.\\nThis stigma gives the impression that residents would be happy to be relocated to new housing built under the Brazilian government’s Minha Casa, Minha Vida (my house, my life) programme – a R$34 billion house-building initiative, which has been used to resettle those removed from favelas. Indeed, it is estimated that 80 per cent \\xa0of Vila Autódromo’s 700 or so families have accepted compensation and moved to alternative accommodation. This is a result of a campaign of pressure by the city described by residents as “psychological warfare” and “terrorism”, combined with increased money offered as compensation.\\nNot everyone has a price. Image: Adam Talbot\\nBut the housing is often poor quality, and essential living costs such as electricity are significantly higher. This has led to accusations that the programme reproduces social inequalities, rather than addressing them. And for the 40 families that remain, the favela is home. One resident showed me around his house, where he had got married ten years ago, showing me photos with a smile on his face and joking with his wife. Their home was placed under eminent domain in March 2015.\\nOrganised resistance\\nOn top of this, Rio’s government has sent military police units to “pacify” the city’s favela communities. These communities have a reputation for being violent and dangerous, and authorities leverage those often misguided perceptions to justify using barbaric levels of force. A vast number of unlawful killings by police have been reported by human rights organisations.\\nAlongside local residents, such organisations have played a significant role in documenting human rights violations in the lead up to the event. For example, the Popular Committee for the World Cup and Olympics in Rio de Janeiro recently released its fourth dossier of human rights abuses, covering the year 2015. Likewise, detailed daily coverage by news site RioOnWatch helps to hold the city to account and encourages residents.\\nRio’s misguided perceptions of favelas, and its intense focus on achieving short-term success over a few days in August, have led the government to pursue this policy of forced evictions and pacification. #\\nBut there is another way. By celebrating the vibrant nature of favela communities, the city could make Vila Autódromo part of the show. The residents are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and have recently played host to events such as cultural festivals and football tournaments .\\nBy viewing favelas primarily as cultural assets, the city could incorporate Vila Autódromo into their plans for the Olympic Park, and use it to showcase the creativity and spirit of Rio, during those few days in August when the world comes to play. It’s not too late for the city to change: to provide upgrades for the residents in Vila Autódromo and use the community to show favelas to the world through a different, positive lens.\\n“Ataque Brasil” plays to the crowd at a cultural festival.

The time has come to dump the piecemeal reforms and decide on a permanent venue for our flagship tournament; it would centralise control over events and even the training of the athletes.\\nMy idea of a permanent Olympic site has been accused of being unrealistic or impractical. However, with every major sporting nation embroiled in one scandal or another over the past 20 years or so, it is clear the solution must be bold and come from the top.\\nWith a central venue, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) can in one masterstroke confirm its rightful place as the epicentre of global sporting excellence and underscore the ideals of the Olympiad where peace and social justice can be promoted through a common global language of sport.\\nIf you build it …\\nThe costs of such a site and infrastructure would be immense, but then the costs right now aren’t chicken feed either. Tens of billions each were spent on the games in Beijing, London and Sochi. You have the bidding process, the campaigning, the planning, the massive infrastructure costs and the extra money proud hosts spend on training athletes to get a morale-boosting result. A single site for summer in Greece, historic home of the Olympics, and winter in neutral Switzerland, would each cost less to construct than recent Games in London and Sochi. Maintenance and running costs would be spread globally rather than resting with one nation..\\nIconic. The UN’s home in NYC. Image: UN.\\nPermanent sites can also provide a sense of gravitas – see the UN in New York for evidence of that – which heightens the moral and political authority of the organisation. This may never have been a more enticing prospect than it is right now. Sports organisations understand the need for “integrity”; the public must believe that true, fair and honest competition is taking place.\\nDevelopment strategies\\nThe waters have been muddied, however. Behind the facade we see lies a vast and wealthy sports industry worth about $145bn\\xa0a year .\\nAnd ever since the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles turned a useful profit , we have become used to hearing that mega-events can be economic (re)generators for the hosts . Many countries link economic development strategies to the attraction of major international sporting events. They hope that they can buy exposure , boost tourism, and deliver supporting infrastructure.\\nPolitical buy-in is a must. Image: UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\\nIf a city is to mount a viable bid to host the Olympics, it needs an enthusiastic government behind it. But the necessarily unequivocal nature of political backing often ignores negative consequences. These can be found at local level near major projects, across the region, or can affect the whole country.\\nHost nations and cities want a sanitised space where imagined visions can be projected to spectators and the global community. Unsightly landscapes are removed and people are moved out of their homes , historic communities are broken down and cost overruns feed into national budgets and can damage citizens’ quality of life.\\nIn other words, the regeneration narrative is no simple tale to pull off; it is fraught with contradictions, questionable in its motivations and unverifiable in its results .\\nAspiration nation\\nBut we are happy to cheer the parade. We put to one side evidence about horrible living and working conditions for workers who produce sporting goods, and we don’t allow forced removals or the suppression of democratic freedoms to ruin our fun. We enjoy our festivals of nationalist celebration, stories of triumph against adversity.\\nA permanent Olympic site could let us do that without the tainted legacy of tawdry campaigns and brutal infrastructure projects. We could eliminate the economic injustices often promulgated in the name of the Olympics.\\nAs the World Anti Doping Authority published its startling report on Russian athletics , however, the debate is less about the mechanics of bidding for the Olympics, than the chemistry of winning gold.\\nThe athletes have always faced the brunt of criticism about doping, but in reality it is born from a structural issue. Simply put, we have a problem because the interests of administrators, coaches, suppliers, scientists and gambling rings all combine to make doping a sane decision; a risk worth taking for the athlete and their teams.\\nThat’s why a permanent Olympic site under the control of IOC-managed training regimes and focused on performance excellence through clean practices would address the core of this structural problem. It would insert another, overriding, interest into that story of the athlete’s career which can challenge the narrative of success at all costs.\\nThe 1896 Olympic Stadium in Athens. Image: Warren Smart/Flickr/CC BY-NC-ND.\\nA single site would allow for tighter controls over performance enhancement, and more efficient and environmentally friendly delivery of Olympic Games competitions. There would be no reliance on diverse national approaches to each. It would also allow the IOC to more easily limit protests and maintain a safe environment for participation, rather than attempting to insert a massive logistical intrusion into one of the world’s major cities.\\xa0\\nAll good news for any skittish corporate sponsors, who would also have their marketing investment more readily protected (no more troublesome\\xa0 “exclusion zones” \\xa0perhaps).\\xa0Control over the entire process of elite sport at the highest level could be maintained directly.\\nIs this likely in the near future? Perhaps not, given the role of nationalism and national governments. But it is worth developing a model for such a site and how it would work practically – for there will come a time when the classical liberal approach of small-scale reforms simply doesn’t cut it any more.\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

The Independent found in 2015 that tens of thousands of families seeking council accommodation have been moved out of London entirely, because there simply isn’t enough space.\\nAnd yet, in one single borough, over 1,000 council flats are currently standing empty. In Hackney, 18 estates are up for “regeneration” (which usually means demolition), and as they wait to be regenerated, the council is emptying them out.\\xa0So Sisters Uncut, a group which campaigns against domestic violence cuts, have decided to put just one of them to good use. On Saturday 9 July\\xa0they marched from Hackney Town hall and occupied a flat on the ground floor of the Marion Court estate in Hackney.\\nThe flat is nice. Really nice. The walls are fully plastered, and the group have replaced the missing carpets and installed curtains adorned with the green and purple Sisters Uncut logo.The campaigners\\xa0tell me that their next door neighbour’s flat is in worse condition;\\xa0and yet, feet away, this flat was standing completely empty. I wondered if they had to break in to start the occupation, but no – the door was simply unlocked.\\xa0\\n“All we did was clean, put some carpets down, and bring in furniture which was donated or we found on Freecycle,” one of the Sisters (the activists generally prefer to remain anonymous) tells me.\\nA list of requested donations in the occupied flat. Image: author’s own.\\nThe flat’s good condition is part of the key message of the occupation: there is unused, good-quality, well-sized\\xa0housing scattered all over London. “Someone now living on this estate was moved out to Basildon while she was doing her GCSEs, and eventually moved back here,” one Sister tells me. “This is a beautiful, three bedroom flat\\xa0lying empty. To say there are no properties for her to live in while she does her studies is an outrageous lie.”\\nSisters Uncut are here\\xa0for two reasons. First, they want to use the otherwise wasted space as a community centre for the local area, which they’ll keep open “as long as possible”. People can drop by whenever they like for a chat, to donate food or other supplies, or come for the children’s breakfast club between 7 and 9 every morning. “We’re also holding housing workshops this week where people can learn their housing rights,” one sister tells me. \\xa0\\nBut they’re also here to make a statement. The group have four key demands for Hackney council, which are inspired by their work for victims of domestic violence, but also gesture at the housing crisis as a whole: no more council flats to be lost as part of regeneration projects; women fleeing domestic violence to be housed in refuges or self-contained properties, not B&Bs; fill the borough’s 1047 empty council properties immediately; and refuse to implement the Housing Act (which would allow for rent rises and further evictions).\\xa0Philip Glanville, Hackney’s deputy mayor, has agreed to speak to the group about their demands, though hasn’t confirmed yet when.\\nIn the 1970s, over 40 per cent of Brits live in council housing; now that proportion is just 8 per cent. Put simply, Sisters Uncut want protection for council homes, not least because a better system could save the lives and livelihoods of those trying to flee abusive relationsips. “It may sound old fashioned,” one tells me, “but we just want proper council housing. That’s what works.”\\xa0\\nWhile the problems around maintaining council housing in an increasingly expensive city may seem intractable, the Sisters argue that they are not – and practical solutions are available. Empty properties should be used, and one Sister suggests that the council should have tried building more expensive “penthouse” apartments on top of existing council blocks, or built more housing on the gaps between blocks, to make money. “At the moment, we’re seeing zero creative solutions”, she says.\\nThese problems are endemic across a city which has a questionable definition of “affordable housing” ( 80 per cent of market rates ), and which often allows developers to dodge even measly affordable housing minumums by paying off councils . So why did the group choose Hackney?\\n“There are lots of empty homes here,” one Sister says. But another adds: “Hackney was\\xa0home to the riots. Since then, the council just hasn’t been listening to the local people. We have an Olympic legacy of nothing.\\n“The only legacy is seeing our communities socially cleansed out.”\\nFollow Sisters Uncut for more information on the occupation here .\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'Share on Facebook\\nIn September 2016, 4,350 Paralympic athletes will arrive in Rio de Janeiro to compete for medals across 23 different sports. The games in Rio have a lot to live up to. London’s 2012 Paralympics proved to be a magnet for sponsorship , and competitors have said that the crowds – and their enthusiasm – were unparalleled.\\nBut there’s another respect in which the 2012 games set the standard for future Paralympic tournaments: it made the host city itself more accessible.\\nIn order to secure their bid for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games, organisers had to make two key promises to do with transport. One was to make public transport a key part of their sustainability agenda. The other was to make London 2012 more accessible than any previous games. London 2012 was planned as a public transport-driven games, and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) took action to maximise its usage.\\nThe challenges\\nTo live up to their promises, the committee had to overcome a number of challenges. Parts of London’s transport system had to undergo a radical overhaul. The commitments also had major implications for venue design, equipment and even the workforce of the games. And because the idea of “legacy” was central to all of the preparations for the games, the solutions put in place needed to work over the long term – not just the main event.\\nWhen LOCOG started its work, disabled people’s confidence in using the public transport network was very low , so there was a need to change people’s perceptions through advertising. The demand from disabled people to attend the Paralympics was higher than expected, but organisers did not know what sort of mix of disabled spectators they needed to plan for. For example, while they knew that many groups of wheelchair users would be arriving, they did not know how many would be using electric wheelchairs, manual wheelchairs or scooters – each of which has different requirements for travel.\\nFinally, the transport system needed to be flexible enough to accommodate the extra short-term influx and diverse needs of disabled people, and revert back to more “standard” operations after the event. For a transport system first developed in the mid-1800s, these were no small demands.\\nQueensway tube station, circa 1900. Image: Pigsonthewing/Wikimedia Commons.\\nThe London Underground – commonly known as “the tube” – was the first underground rail network in the world. At some points, the tracks are almost 60m below ground.\\nModernising such a system involves working around complex arrangements of existing infrastructure. For example, adding a two-lift shaft to Green Park station in central London in time for the games required engineers to build a straight path between pedestrian tunnels, escalators, stairwells and the platforms themselves – not to mention finding the least disruptive times to carry out the developments and space to store the construction equipment.\\nSuch logistics meant that it was impossible for LOCOG to create new accessible entrances into all of the stations. Nevertheless, the organising committee worked with Transport for London, the city’s transport authority, to adapt the public transport system and improve accessibility.\\nThe changes\\nEvidence such as wheelchair ticket sales, pre-booked journeys and increased lift usage suggests that many more people with disabilities were using public transport throughout the games. Tactile paving and protective walls at the platform edges made the system safer for the visually impaired. And 66 of London’s 270 functioning tube stations were fitted with step-free access \\xa0(the overground DLR system was already fully accessible).\\nIn many stations – particularly on the Piccadilly line – the issue was the height difference or the gap between the platform and the carriage floor. Changing the position of the platforms would have been disruptive and costly. So instead, platform ramps were installed across four stops on the Piccadilly line, while manual ramps were provided at 16 strategic stations, to make it easier for wheelchair users to get on and off the train.\\nThese ramps not only benefited disabled people but could be used by the wider community, including parents with pushchairs and tourists with suitcases. They were left in place after the games as part of LOCOG’s legacy commitment –\\xa0and, since then, they have been added to 28 more stations .\\nOf course, there’s still much to be done before London can be a truly accessible city – a fact highlighted by Paralympian Hannah Cockroft, who challenged London mayor Boris Johnson to spend a day navigating the tube in a wheelchair (he declined). And there are concerns that the momentum toward further improvements is waning.\\nBut London 2012 still marked a major leap forward in disabled access to public transport. Through a combination of controlled traffic management, communication with Londoners and collaboration with industry partners, LOCOG was able to develop practical and efficient transport solutions. These did more than fulfil the transport requirements for the Olympic and Paralympic Games: they also left a legacy value for Londoners to enjoy, and set a new standard in games-time transport.\\nNow, Rio is taking the challenge to heart, by launching projects to improve accessibility in the city ahead of the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Indeed, British experts have been actively involved in helping to transfer the learning from London 2012 to improve accessibility for Rio 2016.\\nRio has a golden opportunity to seize this legacy opportunity and set even better standards. Let the games begin.\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

And yet that’s the fate of Burgess Park, a green wedge whose other end reaches the Old Kent Road.\\nBut it wasn’t always thus: once this was all fields or whatever it is actually goes on in the countryside. Then with the 1800s came INDUSTRY – a canal came through, London came down, and the open land had vanished under houses and factories. Later that century you’d get various philanthropists and do-gooders suggesting that at the very least it might be nice to let miserably poor people stand on a bit of grass while they’re being miserable and poor, but it was too late for this particular bit of London.\\nAnd then came the greatest force in British urban planning: the Luftwaffe. They dropped enough bombs on it for Sir Patrick Abercrombie’s 1943 County of London Plan to recommend it as a site for new green space – something the immediate area was already sorely lacking, and would require even more of thanks to plans to develop housing estates in the area. (An irony: as the wheel of regeneration has turned, those estates have since come under threat or even outright demolished, possibly in part because the nice green park makes an ideal place for a property developer to stick some nice posh flats next to.)\\nThe area in 1945. Image: Ordnance Survey.\\nAs it turned out, creating the new park was not exactly an overnight endeavour. For a start, while there had been bomb damage, it was far from total obliteration, and plenty of people still lived and worked in the area. Until the 1960s it remained the site of factories producing R. White’s lemonade (local legend states that this was on occasion used to put out fires after bombing raids) and bibles (praise be to him for giving us this lemonade, presumably).\\nSlowly local authorities, and eventually the Greater London Council, acquired land, as the factories closed and houses were deemed unfit for habitation. But this work was sloooow (which, to be fair, the Abercrombie Plan had predicted it would be). By the 1970s, thirty years after the idea had been proposed, the site was still something of a patchwork. And it didn’t even have a proper name, just a bureaucratic designation as “North Camberwell Open Space”.\\nFinding a permanent name for it appears to have been something of a headache. A Name That Park competition was tried – local authorities, don’t try this now unless you want a park named #ParkyMcParkFaceLOLFBPE – and either through that or inertia, the park briefly got the name ‘St George’s’ presumably after the nearby church.\\xa0Finally, in 1974, it gained the name it’s been known by since –\\xa0in honour of Jessie Burgess, the first female mayor of Camberwell.\\nThe somewhat sedate progress made the whole enterprise slightly contentious – especially if you were one of the people who’d been already been kicked out of your home for it, one imagines. There were even proposals to abandon the idea entirely and Build More Bloody Houses™ – but these were fought off, and by 1982 the park had even acquired a lake, whose bottom could boast that it was had the largest plastic sheet lining in the world.\\nSadly it is lacking what might have seemed like a more obvious water feature: the canal which ran through the site for nearly 150 years. Shut down in the 1940s because road transport made its original purpose redundant, it was filled in and gone by 1960. No-one foresaw that one day post-industrial urban waterways could become attractive features in their own right: the disused canal was a dangerous rubbish dump you had to warn your kids to stay away from. The most obvious evidence for its existence is one of the park’s more notable sights: a bridge over nothing, leading you nowhere.\\nThe bridge to nowhere. Image: Robin Stott.\\nAs late as the early 21st century Burgess Park still had the feeling of being somewhat unloved, crisscrossed with bits of abandoned road that no-one had bothered to do anything about. In a rare moment of not being totally crap in 2009, Boris Johnson launched his “Help a London Park” scheme which among other things invested £2 million in sorting Burgess Park out once and for all. While this was broadly speaking good news for the local community, it was also linked to wider “regeneration” efforts in the area, i.e. trying to kick existing residents out of the nearby Aylesbury estate for the purposes of knocking it down and gentrifying it.\\nSo is Burgess Park finally finished? Maybe not – In 2013 it acquired a flashy new BMX track thanks to an Olympic Legacy Fund. And Southwark Council still occasionally seem to be finding bits of land to buy up: in 2015, a new entrance was opened on the site of a former architectural salvage yard. Maybe they’ll just keep going, buying up more and more land until it achieves its ultimate form.

Not only are the battles for this year’s mayoral elections under way, but metro mayors are also set to be elected in May 2017 in Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region, the North East, Sheffield City Region, the West Midlands, the West of England, Greater Lincolnshire and East Anglia – assuming all the deals currently on the table go ahead, of course. It’s one of the biggest transformations in the way the country is governed that we’ve seen in decades.\\nBut before the new metro mayors come into place in 2017, mayoral elections in London, Liverpool and Bristol will take place on 5\\xa0May this year.\\nAs the campaign develops in each city, the biggest issues will become clearer and clearer. During the eight years Boris Johnson has been in office in London, we’ve seen the delivery of major infrastructure projects including Crossrail 1 (the first station is set to open next year) and the Olympic Park, alongside changes to transport including “Boris Bikes”, new cycle super highways, the controversial Emirates cable car and new Routemaster buses.\\nBut despite a lot of new buildings (not all welcome, according to writers such as\\xa0 Simon Jenkins ) and some new houses being built, there are nowhere near enough to meet demand. And the prices continue to climb well beyond the reach of many living and working in the capital.\\nWhile debates about Boris’s contribution and legacy will doubtless continue, he leaves London still thriving as a global city offering world-class education, culture and places to work and do business. But it is also a city that urgently needs to tackle the challenges of an increasing population: dealing with growing congestion and ensuring availability of affordable, good quality housing to rent and buy must be top of the next London Mayor’s priorities.\\nIn Bristol, the Mayor George Ferguson has been in office for four years, since the mayoral role was first introduced. He is standing again in a fiercely fought contest where his legacy will be debated at length, from the redevelopment of Temple Meads station to the benefits of Bristol’s status as a European Green Capital last year.\\nBristol also faces big issues around\\xa0transport, congestion and the cost of housing, reflecting the challenges that so many economically successful cities face as they grow. Expect debates on everything from parking to schools – and probably a few mentions of George Ferguson’s trademark red trousers.\\nIn Liverpool, Joe Anderson has also been Mayor for four years, since the post was created, and is standing again. Since 2012, Anderson has played an important role in helping to raise the city’s profile, particularly as a destination for global firms to do business – something reflected in the fact that the city has been host to the International Festival of Business since 2014.\\nSome of the biggest issues in this election are likely to be around how best to grow the local economy further and make the most of the city’s proud heritage and shiny new city centre, alongside helping those facing the challenges of unemployment at a time when public expenditure cuts are hitting hard.\\nBoth Liverpool and Bristol also face the additional complexity that these mayoral elections are for the local authority – but both places have now done devolution deals with their wider city regions. Metro mayoral elections are due to take place just a year later: that raises questions about how these cities make the most of the new arrangements, and how to prepare for them over the year ahead.\\nAlexandra Jones is chief executive of the Centre for Cities.\\nThis article was originally published in the Centre for Cities’ Mayoral Elections 2016 blog series , in which \\xa0experts from the worlds of business, housing, local government and academia discuss the big issues ahead of the elections on 5 May.\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'Share on Facebook\\nIt is almost a cliché these days to write that London’s centre of gravity is shifting eastwards. East London has seen the fastest population growth of anywhere in the UK: unlocking its huge growth potential is the key to realising the Mayor’s objective of making London the best big city on earth.\\nBut while public sector investment has poured in over the last 30 years, the creation of the high value jobs that are all important to London’s future hasn’t spread beyond Canary Wharf. The vast majority of the new jobs springing up in Newham, the next borough east, have been in industries such as retail (think the Westfield shopping centre), or hospitality (think the 2012 Olympics).\\nThis matters. City Hall is pursuing a policy of ‘convergence’: that is, achieving the same social and economic opportunities in the east as in the rest of London. That, in turn, means improving access to jobs.\\nBut prevailing economic forces mean that Newham has its work cut out. When deciding where to base themselves, businesses look to the most accessible locations, both to attract the best staff and to be in close proximity to other companies. Consequently, over the past 15 years, the growth of office jobs has been concentrated overwhelmingly in central London and Canary Wharf.\\nThere are signs things are looking up for Newham. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has pre-let 40,000m2 at the International Quarter in Stratford. Meanwhile China’s Advanced Business Parks (ABP) have established their regional headquarters at Newham Dockside, and recently secured permission for a vast new business park at the Royal Albert Dock. The developer has already received 57 signed declarations of interest from Chinese companies about moving into the proposed business park.\\nBut the fact these investments are split between two different districts could create problems in itself. One of the major lessons of Canary Wharf is that it is very difficult to deliver more than one massive regeneration scheme at a time. It takes huge commitments of money and time to give businesses the certainty they require to invest: both, unfortunately, are in short supply.\\nCompetition is also an issue. When Canary Wharf was in its infancy, it was able to accommodate businesses which couldn’t find space in the City. But, over the next 20 years, the pipeline for office development is estimated to be enough to meet demand twice over. Stratford and the Royal Docks will be forced to compete with central London, Canary Wharf and each other. The obvious question, then, is which of the two new districts will come out on top.\\nStratford is a clear winner on location. It’s just 10 minutes from the City, but is able to offer rents at about 60% of those in the Square Mile. It also has a great retail and cultural offer, with the Olympic Park and Westfield on its doorstep. With the FCA commitment, and with One Stratford Place fully let, the future looks bright.\\nBut a quick review of the new building’s occupants suggests a significant presence from quasi-public agencies: not just the FCA, but TfL, Network Rail and the London Legacy Development Corporation. Is the public sector using its buying power to ensure Stratford’s success? And if so, will private firms follow suit?\\nAn artist’s impression of ABP’s Royal Albert Dock development. Image: ABP.\\xa0\\nThe offer at the Royal Docks looks somewhat different. The ABP proposal is intended to be a base for Chinese firms to expand into Europe; it’s even being marketed as ‘London’s Third Business District’.\\nBut there is still a question over whether the Royal Docks are seen as sufficiently attractive to either domestic or foreign-owned firms. The area is half the size of Manhattan: it’ll be hard to coordinate growth or create a coherent sense of place. And London City Airport may be an asset, but it also imposes height and noise constraints.\\nPerhaps the biggest barrier to the area’s development, though, is its infrastructure. Crossrail will help – but with only one station in an area that stretches for 3km, much of the eastern Royal Docks will still be unattractive to higher value firms. Further improvements in road links are critical, too. Research by Atkins suggests that new river crossings could unlock almost 30,000 jobs in East London, many of them in the Royal Docks and at Stratford. The Centre for London will be reporting on how these crossings can be delivered in October.\\nOf course, the strong forces sucking economic activity into the city centre make it far from a foregone conclusion that London will see the rise of a third business district at all. If it does, though, Stratford almost certainly has the edge.

In fact, it has been estimated that coal contributes to 25 per cent of green house gases .\\nCoal use has caused severe negative environmental impacts, from its mining and processing, to its transportation and combustion, leading to high levels of pollution . In October 2017, a United Nations weather agency report indicated that levels of carbon dioxide surged at “ record-breaking speed ” compared to 2016.\\nAround the world, coal mining contributed historically to the industrial revolution and played an important part in the development of modern society. But many mines have since been closed in the UK and Europe. In the UK, this led to hard financial times and unemployment in many communities, including the miners’ strikes of the 1970s and 1980s, an impact recorded in the 1996 movie Brassed Off.\\nBut what happens inside the coalmines after their closure? Surprisingly, most disused coalmines start producing methane – known as Coal Mine Methane (CMM) – which can be a clean source of energy. It can be used to generate electricity via gas engines or, with some technical processing, be fed into the gas grid. Over time, however, the mines will begin to fill with water and the methane will almost entirely disappear.\\nWater, water everywhere\\nBut this will create yet another opportunity. The UK’s historic coal mines have an approximate residual void space of a billion cubic metres. When flooded, that’s the equivalent of 400,000 Olympic swimming pools of water at a stable temperature. This vast volume of water can be used for efficient heating and cooling applications and reduce carbon emissions.\\nBut how? A recent publication by the team at Nottingham Trent University explains . The water in the coalmines is generally at a stable temperature – normally between 12C and 20C depending on the location – which makes it perfect for warming, or cooling, buildings or industrial processes.\\nWe developed and tested a new technology for several years using two systems, one at Markham Vale and one at the National Coal Mining Museum for England , and found it can use this water to provide green, sustainable energy to homes and businesses in the UK.\\nOpportunities and challenges\\nThe technology, which is based on using water source heat pumps, is simple and straightforward and works along similar lines to a refrigerator or air-conditioning system. It produces no noise or local air pollution and is also three or four times more efficient than a standard electric heater or gas boiler.\\nTo understand how heat pumps in general work, consider the refrigerator in your kitchen. This extracts the heat from the food and drinks inside it, and diverts it into the surrounding environment via a condenser (which is simply a radiator) on the fridge’s exterior. Our technology employs a similar system. In this case, we extract the heat from the coalmine water and use it to warm buildings.\\nIn the UK, coal mining technology programmes already pump nearly 112m megalitres of water for environmental reasons, such as avoiding the pollution of drinking water, springs and rivers . The new technology could use this water, which is being pumped anyway, potentially generating 63 megawatts of heat per year.\\nBut the technology has its own challenges, specifically a lack of investment and “champion” organisations to lead the process. In part, this is because it remains a little-known or understood technology by many investors.\\nThere is also a lack of a clear model to follow in the UK when implementing new technologies such as this, not just commercially, but contractually and legally as well. Most housing developers in the UK and Europe, for example, prefer to rely on well-established technologies such as gas boilers or electric heaters, even in areas where coalmines are available. If such new, green technologies are to succeed, comprehensive strategies are needed to get developers – and the general public – on board.\\nHot topic\\nOn the positive side, the technology can be integrated with other heating technologies, and in many cases existing building infrastructure can be used to implement it. The technology can also reduce carbon emissions and energy use and support compliance with the EU Energy Efficiency Directive and UK ESOS regulations .\\nWe also have excellent, large-scale case studies, showing how effective it can be. In Asturias, north-west Spain , for example, a hospital and a university building are already being heated using coalmine water.\\nOur research shows this technology could give the world’s disused coal mines a new, green, lease of life. What a fitting legacy for the industry that would be.\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

Now, add an impeccable arrangement of trees, shrubs and other plants, alongside hardwood benches and sunloungers, with occasional plazas and playgrounds, and you get the final result: the completed High Line, largely funded by private money, one of the most expensive parks per acre in human history\\xa0– and almost certainly the quickest to turn that investment into civic profit.\\nThe genius of the High Line, as is often\\xa0the case with great ideas, was satisfying a desire that had simmered only subconsciously. It is a viewing point, a sunbathing haven, an assembly for street food vendors, a tourist attraction, an idler’s idyll, a garden and also – crucially – a means of getting from A to B. Far from being dourly utilitarian, that usefulness is at the heart of the triumph. The High Line has made us think differently about public space.\\nFifteen years ago, I used to live two short blocks away from the southern tip of the High Line. Yet I almost never walked north along the route the park now follows. Why? As I’ve written in this column before, urban areas often “point” one way rather than the other. My old street “faced” south towards the West Village, rather than north towards Chelsea. When places aren’t enticingly linked up, we tend simply to find amenities in another direction. The aggregate of many such subtly constrained individual lives is a correspondingly diminished city.\\nBut on a recent Sunday, ambling uptown with a friend, taking the High Line not only\\xa0felt natural, it was obvious. Why wouldn’t you take a few steps above street level, escaping the traffic while gorging on the cityscape? We got to where we needed to be; an aesthetic and social experience, a bonus, was thrown into the bargain. The High Line has realised the city planner’s Holy Grail: it has both created space and reduced distance.\\nBy chance, that weekend marked the opening of the park’s newest and final leg, where the High Line changes direction – now east-west, rather than north-south – with unbroken views of the Hudson River to one side and midtown on the other. It has\\xa0perked up the whole area. High Line yoga studios prepare clients for post-workout sustenance at “under the High Line” cafés. The park’s flanks have become a global talent competition for residential and commercial architects, commissioned by developers capitalising on a frenzy of demand. Even though the park inevitably looks over some new properties, the term High Line is real-estate gold dust. Privacy? What privacy? People want to join the party.\\nNo wonder other cities are clamouring to create imitations to transform the urban environment. In terms of ambition London may top the list. In principle, it sounds irresistible: a garden bridge over the Thames. The designer is Thomas Heatherwick, whose cauldron lit up the Olympic opening ceremony; Boris Johnson is an enthusiastic supporter and mayoral sponsor.\\nThe concept image for Skycycle. Image: Foster & Partners.\\nIt is less clear, however, that the Garden Bridge will leave a High Line-style legacy. The cost is already spiralling. In June 2013, it was widely reported to be £60m; now, it’s estimated at £175m. London may be better served by embracing a different transport infrastructure project, one that follows the High Line principle of transforming what is already there. This is SkyCycle. The plan, which is being developed by Foster & Partners, Exterior Architecture and Space Syntax, is to construct cycle highways that follow London’s existing suburban railway corridors – a wide, secure deck constructed above the trains. The result would be a commuter paradise: 220 kilometres of safe, car-free cycle routes accessible from 200 entrance points. The developers estimate that 5.8 million people could reach the network within ten minutes of their front door; all of London’s terminals would be within one hour’s cycling. The cost? Between £8bn and £10bn. By comparison, Crossrail, London’s new railway line, will cost close to £16bn.\\nSkyCycle would certainly be eye-catching – a cycle superhighway suspended in the air. Yet it also responds to one of London’s great problems: allowing people to move around affordably and efficiently. Even after the arrival of Crossrail in 2016, that challenge will only become more acute: London’s population rises by about 80,000 every year, heading towards ten million by 2030.\\nIn an interview with the Guardian on 21 September, Peter Hendy, the head of Transport for London, described the social costs if London fails to improve its commuter infrastructure. “If you’re not able to increase transport capacity and people find accessing work impossible, you risk social unrest. You can expect trouble,” Hendy warned. “If you contemplate a London in 2030 without continuous investment . . . we will have the kind of congestion you’re looking at in Mumbai.”\\nA cycle highway in the sky might not be the most obvious place to begin a quest for commuter solutions and social cohesion. However, SkyCycle has the potential to apply High Line-style methodology, in a way that addresses London’s real problems.\\nThe High Line was a victory for both imaginative ambition and applied practical thinking. The essential raw materials were already in place. It resolved issues that did exist, while creating solutions that no one had anticipated. It wasn’t a glorious folly. Other cities should follow that example but only in their own, unique ways.

Also this bucket of vomit. The Teesside Development Corporation was disbanded three years later; a local MP later condemned it for “often inappropriate and threadbare development”, presumably referring to this musical tragedy.\\nYou’ve Never Seen Anything Like It, Central Milton Keynes\\nMilton Keynes, the archetypal new town, had to get on the crap urban pop train as well. The opening of the town’s shopping centre, developed by Milton Keynes Development Corporation, was celebrated with a promotional silver flexi-disc.\\xa0The song largely consists of ambiguously ambitious claims all the lines of: “You’ve never been anywhere like it, Central Milton Keynes!”\\nThis was, inexplicably, written by the drummer from The Troggs.\\n“Sunny CMK!

Not quite a canal and not quite a river, for centuries the River Lea has been a lifeline of industry taking goods to and from London’s port.\\nThese days the “canalised” waterway and the surrounding Lea Valley have become more centred on leisure, with long walks, rowers and pubs a plenty. But it is when London has been threatened that the Lea has really stepped up, proving itself an all-important means of defence for nervous Londoners.\\nThe Lea’s role as part of the city’s defences stretches back over a thousand years. Before England was even England, the wiley King Alfred the Great messed with the water levels of the river, causing some invading Danes to be trapped with their ships upstream. Stranded with no beard oil, the invaders had little choice but to leg it before Alfred had them truly surrounded.\\nIn the closing decades of the 19th Century, as the British Empire stretched itself across the world, the powers at be started to get a bit more nervous about the neighbours. The London Defence Positions were envisaged to makeup for the fact London was practically indefensible, and consisted of a string of forts around the city, which would be linked up with trenches should the need arise.\\nWhen the First World War kicked off, the old scheme was resurrected and extended to incorporate the River Lea near Broxbourne. By that war’s end, though, trenches had become obsolete in the face of well armoured tanks, which could roll over most things. Deep ditches filled with soldiers were sadly not an exception.\\nCome 1940, with the fall of France, London faced a very real threat of being overrun by Nazi tanks. As panic ensued, the Lea was incorporated into the Outer London Anti-Tank Line under the direction of the aptly named General Ironside. The length of the Lea would form a physical barrier against any invading tanks.\\nHeavy WWII fortifications are more associated with Normandy than east London, but remnants of this defensive line can still be found along the navigation. Observant cyclists crossing the Lea on the Greenway to the south of the Stratford Olympic Park will realise they are pedalling right through WWII era defences. Further south in Bow there are still some pillboxes to be found.\\nThe Lea saw further use in the wars, as a way of transporting ammunition safely from the Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills: the smooth movement of barges was seen as a safer bet than the potholed roads for transporting volatile explosives. The defensive structure above was intended as an anti-aircraft position most likely to protect the Mills themselves.\\nSo if you get the chance to take a stroll along the Lea, maybe you can now appreciate it for more than an afternoon activity. Between the hungry geese and the futile fishermen, try to spot the material remnants of Ironside’s defensive ring. And rest easy knowing that, should tanks ever threaten London again, the Lea has got your back.\\xa0\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n']\n"

While they might cost more to hold than they immediately earn back they’re meant to leave behind a “legacy” a conveniently vague notion taking in well-maintained stadiums and sport-loving children. As no less an authority than the International Olympic Association says the games are expected to leave behind “more than just good memories”.\\xa0\\nIn some cities the Games deliver on this hazy prophecy. Others are left with ghost town Olympic villages and “white elephant” stadiums*. Debt can be another a nasty reminder of the Games’ excesses: the Quebec government ended up introducing a new tax on tobacco to pay off Montreal’s whopping Olympic bill. Damaging Olympic legacies may well have contributed to the general lack of interest in hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics (all but two cities have dropped out of the bidding process ).\\nSo why do some games leave golden legacies while others take the metaphorical form of a large destructive pet?\\n“Sydney’s games apparently accelerated the growth of ‘brand Australia’ by 10 years”\\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) publishes a factsheet outlining the long-lasting benefits for its host cities. For some even the length of the entry speaks volumes: Vancouver 2010 gets two pages; Nagano Japan just a quarter of a page.\\nMore damning are those reports in which airy untestable claims are presented in place of concrete achievements. In Beijing for example 400 million schoolchildren were apparently “exposed to Olympic values” while Sydney’s games “accelerated the growth of ‘brand Australia’ by ten years”. Other reports have shown that Sydney’s games drove more people to watch TV than ever before – a positive effect for the country’s networks but arguably not top of the priority list for anyone else.\\xa0\\nLast February former US presidential candidate Mitt Romney wrote an op-ed slamming excess spending on the games and arguing that Greece’s $11bn spend on Athens 2004 “pushed the country towards collapse”. He had a point: Athens constructed purpose-built sporting venues a long way out of town. These are now rarely used and barely maintained with stopped clocks and damaged facilities that have become the subject of photo essay after photo essay .\\xa0\\nYet Barcelona which reportedly spent $9.3bn on the 1992 Games – the equivalent of $12.5bn in 2004 – remains one of the biggest Olympic success stories. The key was the city’s decision to spend only 9.1 per cent of its budget on the operating costs of the Games themselves; the remaining $8.5bn the vast majority of the funding went on improving the city’s transport and services and constructing two miles of beach on a stretch of coast previously occupied by industrial buildings\\nBarcelona’s Port Vell harbour built for the 1992 games. Image: Diliff at Wikimedia Commons.\\nThe Sochi winter games cost $51bn the highest price tag ever recorded. Human rights abuses stories of bribery and logistical mess-ups (what better way to generate bad press than putting up journalists in unfinished hotels ?) marred the image of the Games themselves.\\nYet Sochi was far from a straightforward tale of failure: the Games kickstarted long-lasting development in the region including the completion of an airport (which had been on pause since 1989) and improvements to power telecommunications and access for the disabled.\\nThe success stories on the whole are those which prioritised forward planning at the expense of the wow-factor. Before the 1984 LA Olympics officials decided that only two sporting facilities would be built for the Games. That meant the \\xa0$413m cost of the event – a snip compared to the $1.35bn spent by Moscow four years before – was almost entirely spent on other projects. The profits from the games were reinvested into projects like LA84  a youth sporting foundation.\\nCompare and contrast with Montreal’s 1976 Games which may well have the worst legacy of all. The greatest disaster was unsurprisingly the stadium. Construction originally cost at $770m; by the time the debts were finally paid off 30 years later the figure had reached $1.5bn.\\nMontreal’s Olympic stadium paid for by the city’s smokers. Image: Tolivero at Wikimedia Commons.\\nLondon had a near-miss. In 2008 mayor Boris Johnson slammed the lack of post-Games proposals for the Olympic park and final plans for the park were not unveiled until August 2012 weeks after the Games’ completion. Better managed were the original proposals for the sporting structures. Of the venues used 95 per cent were hired out while 25 temporary venues were constructed. The permanent venues have been converted for community use leaving the city with no looming useless sporting structures. The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park which opened to the public in July 2013 has already received over 1 million visitors and in the words of London’s mayor Boris Johnson forms the “glittering centrepiece” of the post-Olympics regeneration effort in East London.\\nIt looks like Germany at least has learnt these lessons. Both Berlin and Hamburg have put forward remarkably restrained proposals for the 2024 Summer Olympics; both feature inner-city building and the reuse of existing venues too.\\nThere’s no one size fits all formula for a successful legacy – not least because the challenges facing host cities in advanced economies are so different to the ones facing emerging ones. According to the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development  the cost to emerging markets is usually higher; as in Sochi however investment purportedly for the Games can be used to boost infrastructure and living conditions making the return on this investment look pretty worthwhile. The lasting legacy of the Beijing Olympics is not its Birdcage stadium now touted to be transformed into a shopping and entertainment centre: it’s in the improvements to sanitation air quality and transport that came with it.\\n\\xa0\\n*This phrase “white elephant” incidentally comes from a story in which Siamese kings gave the animals to annoying courtiers as they would cost so much to maintain or dispose of that they would ruin the recipient. So now you know.\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'Share on Facebook\\nEver since the 1992 games in Barcelona the idea of “legacy” has played a crucial role in the process of bidding for and hosting the Olympics. It’s easy to agree that investment and development for the Olympics should deliver benefits for residents of the host city in the long run. And it makes sense that Olympic infrastructure is built in areas that need improvement.\\nBut in practice it’s not always locals who benefit from the Olympic legacy. All too often strict deadlines for delivery of Olympic infrastructure give authorities and developers a license to push urban regeneration plans through to approval with minimal consultation. In Beijing for instance 1.5m people were displaced to make space for Olympic venues. Meanwhile in Rio thousands of favela dwellers experienced violent evictions ahead of this year’s games.\\nSimilarly – but somehow less famously – the Olympic Park developments for London 2012 involved the largest programme of legally enforced evictions in England. And it continues to this day.\\nWelcome to Hackney Wick\\nHackney Wick and Fish Island is a quaint former industrial area in east London right at the edge of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Old warehouses – many of which have been converted into spaces for living working eating and making – sit beside canals and old-fashioned barges line the banks. Here more than 600 artist studios and other small creative organisations have produced an ecosystem which nurtures innovation and creativity.\\nA creative idyll. Image: Ilaria Pappalepore/University of Westminster/author provided.\\nNow this area is part of a major regeneration project and most of these artists feel under threat. Currently one group of creatives based in Fish Island is fighting an eviction letter delivered just six weeks before part of the building where the individuals work and live is due to be demolished.\\nThe building – Vittoria Wharf – is one of many which were subject to compulsory purchase before the games by the London Legacy Development Corporation – the public company responsible for delivering Olympic-led regeneration in east London.\\nA petition to save Vittoria Wharf from demolition has so far reached more than 2700 signatures. But this action is unlikely to save the building – at best it will give residents a few more months to make their case public. A local musician said to me: “I feel they almost treat us as Conquistadors treated native Americans with no respect for our philosophies.”\\nPutting up a fight Image: Ilaria Pappalepore/University of Westminster/author provided.\\nThese residents are aware of the well-documented cycle of gentrification  which sees deprived neighbourhoods initially inhabited by young artists who are later displaced by established creative companies and middle-class residents.\\nNew creative enclaves are commonly formed in cities this way over time. But in London young artists worry that soon there will be nowhere left for them to go in the city. One of the residents of Hackney Wick told me that artists’ only option is to relocate to other parts of England – such as Margate on the east coast – or to go abroad with Berlin the most popular option. With the average London house price pushing £472000 and rent becoming prohibitively expensive in more and more boroughs there is a real danger that low-income artists could be priced out.\\nLooking back at London 2012\\nLocal artists’ difficulties with the legacy of the Olympics follows their disappointment with the games themselves. Research I conducted between 2010 and 2014 showed that the games had minimal positive impacts on local artists and other small creative organisations.\\nMany were disappointed by how difficult it proved for local artists and companies to take part in the cultural programme of London 2012. A key problem flagged up by my interviewees was the curators’ preference for internationally renowned artists over local ones. Unfortunately this stems from the nature of mega-events which are highly dependent on sponsorships and international media attention.\\nBut as one cultural policy consultant interviewed for the research said:\\n[The cultural programme curators] saw themselves as trying to do something substantially different and of better quality and more international and a lot more contemporary than a lot of the practice they thought they were looking at in east London. Not to take seriously any of the talent that is on their doorstep except around the edges and kind of cosmetically seems to me to be fundamentally misdirected.\\nIn Hackney Wick organisers went so far as to remove graffiti by local artists only to replace it with specially-commissioned pieces by international artists. In many ways London missed an invaluable opportunity to promote local creativity.\\nEvocative art in Hackney Wick by Edwin. Image: Mabacan/Flickr/creative commons.\\nFor security reasons visitors were carefully marshalled between train stations and Olympic venues which prevented them from wandering around the area. What’s more the International Olympic Committee’s extremely restrictive copyright rules made it impossible for local artists to use Olympic-related symbols in their practice – although some did so anyway as a form of resistance.\\nA new cultural quarter?\\nYet the Olympic regeneration programme did have a small number of positive outcomes for local residents. One of the very few aspects which seems to have been well received by the artists we spoke to is the plan for a culture and education district  to be built on the Stratford waterfront in the Olympic park by 2020.\\nThis project – dubbed “Olympicopolis” by former London mayor Boris Johnson – was initially inspired by “Albertopolis”; the cultural cluster built in South Kensington following the Great Exhibition in 1851. The new cultural district will accommodate world class cultural and education institutions such as the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) Sadler’s Wells theatre University College London (UCL) and London College of Fashion. Both UCL and the V&A have already liaised with local Hackney Wick artists with a view to develop creative collaborations.\\nThe project is expected to create 3000 jobs and contribute to the wider cultural legacy strategy for the Olympic Park which is “centred around developing east London as a creative destination with an international reputation”.\\nBut given what happened at London 2012 there’s a real risk that this new development could once again create a “tourist bubble” – a sanitised cultural island completely separated from the local neighbourhood. Indeed the plans for the new district – which were unveiled very recently – have already been described as “a cacophony of luxury stumps”.\\nPrevious research has shown that successful creative areas are characterised by a diverse built environment a bohemian look and the coexistence of people who produce and consume culture. Yet all of this already exists in Hackney Wick and Fish Island thanks to a community which has been there since long before the Olympics. The question is – will it still be there in five years?\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation . Read the original article .\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'Share on Facebook\\nThe recent publication of consultancy Moore Stephens’ report into London’s Olympic Stadium has reasserted the importance of the concept of legacy in London’s post-Olympic landscape.\\nIn 169 pages the report meticulously outlines the various failings in the conversion of the London Stadium from an Olympic venue to West Ham United FC’s Premier-League new home. A sizeable proportion reads as a direct criticism of mayor Sadiq Khan’s predecessor Boris Johnson and his questionable decisions about the bidding process to occupy the stadium.\\nWhen West Ham were awarded tenancy in the London Stadium (for the second time) it was championed as a great success by organisers who had secured a legacy for the iconic venue. However we seem to have reached a rather embarrassing point in this ‘secured legacy’. Its publicly owned operator E20 is losing money with each game played; and West Ham have been granted a very favourable deal at the expense of the British taxpayer. As well as this West Ham’s first season was marred by fan violence security issues and poor performances on the pitch. While this may not officially be a white elephant it is at least a claret-and-blue one.\\nThe recent revelations concerning the London Stadium have brought the broader problems of Olympic legacy into sharp focus. What is legacy? Can it be measured? Whose legacy are we talking about it? Who is entitled to claim the success or failure of legacy?\\nFrom the get-go the London 2012 bid was oriented around this notion of legacy and although the promises were subtly realigned over the years two pillars stood firm throughout. First was to encourage and increase participation in sport. Second was the widespread regeneration of a previously “under-developed” post-industrial part of east London Stratford.\\nLondon’s success in winning the bid over competitors such as Paris lay in its optimistic teleology. Put simply it explained legitimated and planned the 16-day spectacle as a function of its legacy. London was adamant that it would not repeat the failures of preceding games . It would not become a desolate wasteland littered with white elephants but instead would become a “new piece of the city” stitched into its regenerating surroundings.\\nLegacy is an immensely powerful concept in Olympic urbanism but is also incredibly vague. Both its breadth and its haziness explain its allure. It offers up visions of a future city yet sits uncomfortably with the rest of the Olympic project.\\nOlympic time is characterised by a rigid linearity. The achievements of its athletes are measured against the clock all events take place within a 16-day period and the games run in cycles of four years. So a tension exists between the ephemerality of the games themselves and the permanence of their effects. The pre-game phase is characterised by planning deadlines and most importantly the date of the opening ceremony. Time is a fixed entity with an immovable end point. The most important consideration for the host city is to deliver the games on time. Compare this to after the games have moved on where time exists in a much more fluid and uncertain way.\\nThere are also interesting differences between “legacy” and “impact”. Whilst impacts are generally short-term and measurable legacy is framed as a longer-term issue. The Olympics clearly have impacts on the city but legacy is an abstract idea a discourse used to justify hosting the Games.\\nIn 2007 the Greater London Authority named its five legacy promises : increasing opportunities for Londoners to become involved in sport; ensuring Londoners benefit from new jobs businesses and volunteering opportunities; transforming the heart of East London; delivering a sustainable games and developing sustainable communities; and showcasing London as a diverse creative and welcoming city.\\nTaking the third of these promises – transforming the heart of East London – it becomes clear how vague legacy is. That statement begs a number of questions. What does transformation mean and how is it measured? Where is the heart of east London? Who decides how east London is spatially defined?\\nOr take “developing sustainable communities”. What does a sustainable community mean? Does this imply that previous communities were unsustainable? What does this say about how local people are viewed in relation to the construction of the Olympic spectacle?\\nThe vision: an artist’s imrpession of the London Olympic Park before construction began. Image: London 2012.\\nHow then should we begin to analyse or interpret London’s Olympic legacy? Can legacy ever be achieved and come to an end? If so when can it be fairly interpreted? Considering the London Stadium as either a successful securing of legacy or as a pyrrhic victory in the battle against white elephant-ism nevertheless assumes a fixed point in time. Even if at this specific moment the London Stadium seems to be an embarrassment of failings this situation may change now it has been taken back under mayoral control.\\nAny discussion of London’s urban Olympic legacy must consider that it does not exist in a vacuum but must be contextualised by broader urban histories and contexts. Outcomes and impacts linked to processes beyond the Games become classified as purely Olympic-led urban phenomenon massively simplifying the ways in which urban space develops.\\nBecause legacy is such a multifaceted concept how can it be fairly unpacked and re-assembled to make an informed decision about whether hosting the Olympics was “worth it”? Is it even possible to measure legacy?\\nSo should the overall legacy of the games be judged on the recent stadium report? Or should it be measured in line with the stadium’s recent Instagram post  celebrating the fact that the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park is the UK’s fourth-most instagrammed sports location this year? Sadly the latter increasingly seems like a desirable metric by which urban regeneration schemes should be assessed.\\nWhile legacy was originally championed to get hesitant members of the public onside and promise them vague visions of a future over which they have now control legacy discourse now serves to legitimate significant decisions and smooth-over failures in planning large-scale urban regeneration projects.\\nSo far if 2012 has taught us anything about Olympic legacy perhaps it is how flawed the idea of promising legacy is. What begins as a vague discourse inevitably becomes transformed by political cycles and in this instance the 2008 financial crash and subsequent years of austerity.\\nDespite the problematic nature of this legacy discourse this does not mean that east London would have been better off had it not hosted the Games. However regeneration could certainly have been managed far better to channel the benefits of Olympic urbanism to those impacted most by the games.\\nThis positive-negative legacy dynamic pervades most areas of Olympic urbanism and makes it very difficult to decide whether hosting the Olympics is positive or negative for cities. All in all the opaque nature of Olympic legacy adds to its mythic nature and enduring urban appeal.\\nBenedict Vigers is a postgraduate student at the University of Cambridge currently studying an MPhil in architecture & urban studies.\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'Share on Facebook\\nIt was raining on 12 May the last time I was in Rio. The cidade maravilhosa – the “Marvelous City” – was cold and dark the furthest thing from the vibrant jovial landscapes you’ll see on a Google image search.\\nThe rain didn’t deter thousands of workers pulling 12-hour shifts to finish construction for the 2016 Summer Olympics but the overall mood was just as gloomy; 12 May was also the day that the Brazilian senate voted to suspend President Dilma Rousseff and begin an impeachment trial.\\nI’ve been to Rio dozens of times and because I’m a scholar of modern architecture and public space I couldn’t help but look at how the city had changed for better or worse in preparation for the Summer Olympic Games.\\nAs I rode via Uber for two hours from Rio to the airport seeing construction everywhere I knew how closely related it was to the country’s political problems. Kickbacks from large infrastructure projects were used to finance campaigns of all major political parties.\\nI started asking myself the question that I’m sure every citizen of Rio will entertain in one way or another in the near future. Was is worth it? What would be the legacy of all this construction – if not the demolition of Brazilian democracy happening right before our eyes?\\nThe construction frenzy tied to the Olympics should lead to much-needed infrastructure improvements and the Rio Olympics did spur the development of a number of museums and cultural institutions. But that development – often conducted behind closed doors with little public accountability – has come at a cost.\\nBuildings that benefit whom?\\nTwo blocks after leaving my hotel my Uber passed one of these new museums: the MIS ( Museu da Imagem e do Som  or “Museum of Image and Sound”).\\nAn elegant and complex structure designed by American architects Diller Scofidio and Renfro the building – which broke ground in 2014 but won’t be ready in time for the Olympics – projects a series of ramps on the main facade. The visitors will have a hard time deciding if they should look to the collection inside or to the bright Copacabana beach outside. I commend the architects for offering the choice instead of blocking the view (as others proposed). Nevertheless a recent Ph.D. dissertation by scholar Lidia Quieto revealed how opaque the competition process – organized by the powerful Roberto Marinho Foundation the cultural arm of the Brazilian media conglomerate Rede Globo – really was.\\nThe Museum of Image and Sound remains under construction. Image: Marcelo Horn/Wikimedia Commons.\\nDoes it have to be like that? Could an architectural competition be held with transparency and public spirit in mind?\\nApparently not in Rio.\\nThis general disregard for the public good has bled over to other decisions tied to Olympics. Years ago I interviewed Gabriel Solis a San Antonio-based architect who served on the jury of the competition for the Rio Olympic Park. The proposed location sat on marshlands that are extremely sensitive to land removal and vulnerable to erosion. But Solis told me that environmental concerns were simply cast aside during the decision-making process. At the time – in 2014 – Solis was happy that the jury had at least managed to guarantee the permanence of Vila Autódromo an informal settlement that occupied a tiny part of the site.\\nTwo years later on the verge of the opening of the Olympic Games Vila Autódromo is no more . Because the developers didn’t want a favela anywhere near the apartments they’d need to sell after the Olympic Games the city negotiated with individual occupants and demolished their houses as soon as they agreed to leave. Living in the middle of rubble and under the threat of forced relocation the majority of the families accepted the city’s cash offer and left. The 25 families that resisted until the end will still have their homes demolished but will be able to inhabit new ones built in their place.\\nThe pluses and minuses of the new port\\nMy Uber continued to downtown Rio where people weren’t so lucky. The redevelopment of the port area – Porto Maravilha – removed 22059 families from their homes .\\nBut the port area also contains one of the few positive outcomes of Rio 2016: the demolition of the Perimetral  a double-decker highway that used to snake along the seashore. As we rode through the congested streets of downtown Rio on that rainy afternoon the traffic wasn’t ideal. But it also wasn’t any worse than it was a few years ago with the elevated highway. Visiting Paço Municipal (the old imperial residence) and viewing Guanabara Bay – unobstructed by the Perimetral – is a sight to behold.\\nThe Perimetal under demolition in 2013. Image: Getty.\\nHalf a mile north are two new museums: one that celebrates everything good about contemporary architecture and one that epitomises everything wrong with it. The Museu de Arte do Rio (Rio’s Museum of Art) is the good one. Here two existing buildings were renovated by the firm Bernardes Jacobsen; they’re now connected by an elegant new canopy that creates a pleasant terrace. It doesn’t hurt that the Museu de Arte also has a wonderful collection of art with a focus on works that have made Rio their subject matter.\\nAcross the Museu de Arte sitting on a white-stoned platform that is blinding on sunny days is a strange metallic structure designed by world-famous Santiago Calatrava. Called Museu do Amanhã (“Museum of Tomorrow”) it seems to be no more than a symbol of a lost opportunity. The museum has no collection just a series of virtual displays; when I visited the exhibits couldn’t hold my attention for more than a few seconds each. What I did notice was how foreign and unfit that big white skeleton looked in Rio. Did I mention that much like the Olympics  Calatrava’s projects are notorious for going way over budget ?\\nA model of city building gone awry\\nAs the Olympic Games begin it has become clear that Rio 2016 is already a missed opportunity. The subway extension to Barra da Tijuca will operate only on a limited schedule (probably for Olympic ticket-holders only). The light rail downtown will also operate on a reduced course. Of the two big architectural monuments tied to the Olympic Games one will not be ready (Museu da Imagem e do Som) and the other (Museu do Amanhã) isn’t worth a visit. Thousands of families were displaced; thousands of apartments will take their place and make gentrification worse than it already is.\\nYes the Bus Rapid Transit lines are working fine while both the TransOeste and the TransCarioca bus corridors are operating at full capacity serving half a million people everyday and reducing carbon emissions by 40 percent. But one new piece of infrastructure has already collapsed : On April 21 a 50-foot-long piece of a dedicated bicycle lane that had opened in January collapsed into the ocean killing three cyclists.\\nAll this should be just another case of bad infrastructure planning and investment. But it’s much worse. Over the past 20 years Rio has implemented an entire model of city building that’s relied on gentrification campaign finance kickbacks and forced relocations; now that model is being used by the entire country. As the New York Times recently wrote the political party that ruined Rio is the same that is supporting a coup against Dilma Rousseff.\\nIt’s sad that the Rio 2016 Olympics might be remembered for three collapses: the demolition of the downtown Perimetral highway (1960-2016) the collapse of the bicycle lane (January to April 2016) and the implosion of Brazilian democracy (1985-2016).\\nRebuilding the last will be an Olympic proposition.\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

Here’s her view of the games and their legacy.\\nNo sooner had the 2016 Olympic Games finished than commentators were lamenting their negative impacts on the host city Rio de Janeiro. Many have concluded that a sustainable Olympic legacy is either uncertain or downright impossible.\\nBut while these tales of doom and gloom make for dramatic headlines the reality is not so grim.\\nThe international press have always been pessimistic about Brazil’s ability to stage the Olympics. Before the games began a steady flow of articles critiqued the preparations  condemned forced evictions and cast doubt on whether vital infrastructure would be delivered on schedule. Admittedly in the context of the ongoing economic crisis and political turmoil there was – and still is – good cause for concern. But it is important not to get fixed on controversies as the only source of truth.\\nOnce the games started the city was given a short break and the focus moved to the wonders of sport – and obsessive medal counting. But after many were swept up in the thrill of the games themselves it didn’t take long for the criticisms to return .\\nIn contrast with this bleak picture my own research on Rio throughout the games fortnight building on a framework that interrogates the cultural dimensions of this as well as eight previous host cities since Sydney 2000 reveal a different dimension of the Olympic city this summer.\\nThe art of progress\\nThe people I spoke to were frustrated that uplifting stories about the urban social and cultural changes taking place in Rio were not being picked up by journalists. This was especially clear in Rio’s favelas  where I conducted the bulk of my research. These informal slum-like settlements span across the city’s hills and have attracted worldwide attention for their poor living conditions and the high crime rates associated with drug dealing.\\nWhile internal gang wars have resulted in targeted violence for decades favela residents insist they are also part of strong and optimistic communities. Those outside of gang rivalries say that they feel safe and well supported within their neighbourhood and that culture and creativity has always been a source of empowerment .\\nDJ Zezinho speaks to a Russian TV crew about his work as community DJ in Rocinha. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nIn particular cultural activists working in the favelas such as DJ Zezinho and Obi Wan told me that they were fed up with being asked to talk about everything that is wrong in Rio. They said that their community life is thriving and opportunities are opening up for residents like Obi Wan who got a grant to study at a private school and is now running a popular youth hostel and favela tours .\\nArtists (both home-bred and adopted) are also bringing about positive changes to their neighbourhoods. The International Olympic Committee’s first artist-in-residence – photographer and street artist JR – has taken a prominent role in a number of projects at the Olympic Games.\\nJR’s InsideOut. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nHis work ranges from the monumental Giants to portraits of Olympic participants ( InsideOut ) to small community-focused interventions – such as a cultural centre Casa Amarela  based in one of Rio’s oldest favelas.\\nWhat’s more the first favela-based libraries are opening up and the new Olympic metro line will improve accessibility to Rio’s most prominent favela Rocinha. Residents are hopeful that this will finally make it plain that favelas are truly a part of Rio – they weren’t even recognised on official maps until 2013 .\\nLocal entrepreneur Obi Wan speaks in front of Rocinha graffiti sensation Wark whose work is spread throughout Rio and internationally. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nOf course locals’ reactions to the Olympics aren’t all positive. One Rocinha resident pointed out: “We are not allowed to use the metro until after the games – at the moment only Olympic competition ticket holders can.” But in the wake of extensive drug lord removals and pacification – a controversial but transformative effort to fight crime in the favelas which was accelerated as the Olympics were looming – no one denies that the big event has helped advance important social causes and address essential public infrastructure needs.\\nIt’s not just residents of the favelas who are feeling some benefits from hosting the games. Despite Rio’s reputation for being a city of great inequality  it does actually have a substantial middle class. Between 60 per cent\\xa0and 75 \\xa0per cent\\xa0of its population live in four large districts: the historic downtown Centro the flashy Zona Sul the largely low-income residential Zona Norte and the suburbs of the west side.\\nThe latter includes Barra da Tijuca – the site of the main Olympic Park which is rapidly developing as new more wealthy communities move in. The Olympic Games have given Rio’s middle-class residents – particularly those in Centro and Zona Norte – a chance to participate in the debate around the kind of city Rio is and could be.\\nNo-go to must-go\\nBoth city and Olympic officials have made much of the claim that 63 per cent\\xa0of the population now have access to public transport (up from 18 per cent seven years ago). But an equally important (and culturally more significant) Olympic legacy for Rio is the rediscovery of its public spaces as areas for people to meet and mingle.\\nThe Olympic Boulevard in Porto Maravilhas was the most popular site for collective (unticketed) celebration during the games. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nJust as Barcelona rediscovered its port during the 1992 Olympics Rio has reconnected with the long-derelict Porto Maravilhas. The Porto borders downtown Centro an area which bustles with office workers from all across the city during the week.\\nBut up until recently Centro lacked public meeting spaces and was considered an unsafe no-go area in the evenings and on weekends. This has changed dramatically for the duration of the Olympic Games (and carrying on into the Paralympics). Porto Maravilhas has been rebranded as the Boulevard Olimpico – and suddenly it’s the place to be.\\nA dedicated Olympic “live site” where fans can watch the action on big screens the Boulevard Olimpico owes its success to the ingenious combination of a diverse cultural offering (including the new Museum of Tomorrow and the revamped Museum of Art in Rio ) with business displays and entertainment.\\nHuge works from Kobra has encouraged other artists to work in the area. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nWhat’s more the thoughtful way the space has been used sparked a flurry of street artists (five so far and counting) to take over old warehouse walls and produce enormous graffiti artworks.\\nAnd this is only the second time – after Vancouver’s Winter Olympics in 2010 – that an Olympic Cauldron was placed outside the sports venue giving those without tickets the chance to experience one the most recognisable Olympic icons first hand.\\nThe eco-friendly Olympic Cauldron has become one of Rio’s favourite sites for selfies. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nSo Cariocas have flocked in their thousands to the Boulevard Olympico. They have fully embraced this new part of their city: there will be no white elephants here. The port has passed from no-go to must-go area in a matter of months and given its position as meeting point for daily commuters it is set to become one of the most lively and diverse public places in the city.\\nA lasting legacy\\nThe Parque Madureira in the northern part of the city is another example of urban regeneration leaving a positive legacy for the local community. Located in a densely populated low-income area which is dominated by factory infrastructure this new park has brought greenery sporting facilities and new cultural life to a neighbourhood of more than 350000 people.\\nThe largest set of Olympic rings are placed at Madureira park in low-income Zona Norte. Image: Beatriz Garcia/author provided.\\nRio is a big city. With Olympic activities dotted across the four main districts hardcore sports fans have been forced to spend a considerable part of their day in transit. Because of this visitors have been exposed to the many sides of Rio beyond the sandy beaches in Copacabana and the dirty streets in the slums.\\nAbove all else the games have showcased the generous spirit of the Carioca. While in Rio I witnessed the locals’ thrill at discovering new spaces to gather exercise and party; their enjoyment and surprise at mixing with people from other districts – often for the first time given the city’s longstanding north-south economic divide and their refusal to be confined by stereotypes and condemned to repeat the same social and cultural mistakes.\\nThere are hard times ahead; the country still faces an ongoing recession and political turmoil. But the Olympic Games have opened up new public spaces giving everyone the chance to generate positive collective memories – with the Paralympics yet to come. Rather than taking on a defeatist “can’t-do” attitude there is much to be gained by paying attention to what’s gone right in Rio.\\nBeatriz Garcia \\xa0is head of research and cultural policy at the\\xa0Institute of Cultural Capital University of Liverpool .\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation . Read the original article .\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'Share on Facebook\\nIt’s been over six months since the Olympic games came to a close in Rio. With the benefit of hindsight many are surveying the city with a critical eye wondering whether the multi-billion dollar mega-event was worth it.\\nWhen a city is graced by the pinnacle of cultural and sporting celebration that is the Olympic Games it also carries out a programme of ambitious urban development: from short-term regeneration to longer-term infrastructure works. Since the start of the century such non-sporting outcomes have become a major part of the bidding process for would-be host cities.\\nToday a bid to host the Olympics can provide a powerful political will for change pool public and private money together in enormous funds and catalyse urban development at an astounding rate.\\nMixed visions\\nYet event-led policies are complex. They cut across many different locations affecting communities and businesses in myriad ways. Competing interests must be prioritised and those with money and power are often better able to influence outcomes to their advantage than poorer less “visible” residents.\\nRio’s favelas offer a case in point. Around 23-24 per cent of the city’s population live in informal or slum housing and many were hit with forced evictions to make way for sports facilities or transport routes. One civil society group calculated that 22059 families were evicted across the city ahead of mega-events between 2009 and 2015 – that’s approximately 77206 people .\\nHere we find that mega-events escape from the confines of democratic planning and avoid the progressive plural and consultative processes typically found as part of the “normal” governance of daily life. Scholars have observed that during the planning and delivery periods host cities symbolise “Olympic states of exception”  wherein urban policies are fast-tracked to deliver the infrastructure in time for the games.\\nThe vision for Rio’s Olympic legacy drew a mixed response before the games even began so now that they’re over the city is in for some heavy scrutiny. To even the most optimistic eye it’s clear that in places reality falls far short of the dream.\\n\\xa0\\nA post shared by Victor Den Heijer (@victordenheijer) on\\nFeb 20 2017 at 3:58am PST\\nVenues remain without owners part-functioning or in complete disarray . They are transforming into text-book examples of “white elephants”; flashy developments built for show which fall out of use and become a burden on public funds once the party is over. For the residents of a city which was already struggling in the grips of economic political and health crises  this must be especially frustrating.\\nA ray of hope\\nBut while the physical remnants of the games are withering the cultural legacy of Rio’s Porto Maravilha shines bright. Before being made-over for the games  the area had a reputation for being unsafe: abandoned buildings were blemished by broken windows and locals avoided walking there after dark.\\nBut now six months on it’s the place to be: throngs of people can be seen cycling or strutting across what was the largest ever “ live site ” in Olympic history. The Porto Maravilha has become a cultural hub where locals and visitors gather to eat local street food and soak up the sights which include attractions such as My Porto Maravilha and one of the world’s largest murals .\\nOf course this kind of urban make-over can have unintended consequences. Gentrification occurs when major structural and economic changes force lower income communities out of an area and it’s one of the biggest challenges faced by Olympic host cities past and future.\\nIn the case of the Barcelona 1992 games it was found that gentrification “ changed the social mix ” of local communities and caused house prices to jump 250 per cent between 1986 and the start of the games. Similarly since the Olympic park was constructed for London 2012 the thriving community of artists in nearby Hackney Wick has been threatened with displacement.\\nRegeneration is a two-sided coin : it can raise the standards of living for local residents – or progressively drive them out entirely. The risk is that every time Olympic developments price out locals by driving up housing costs it makes the prospect of hosting the Olympics a little less attractive .\\nThe truth is much of the story of Rio’s Olympic legacy has yet to be written and what counts as a win to some may feel like a sore loss to others. There will be businesses that continue to ride the wave of trade after the event while creatives capitalise on the port’s new cultural scene. But there will also be poorer more vulnerable residents struggling to find and settle into new homes. Perhaps the best way to judge is to visit and see for yourself.\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

He has cleaned out his desk and moved on to bigger and better things.\\nBut Johnson got London’s housing badly wrong – and it is worth reflecting on the reasons why he presided over the rise and rise of the capital’s biggest crisis. Why on his watch did housing become the domain purely of the big guys with their overblown solutions? Why is the cupboard bare? Has it all been one big bodge?\\nTo be fair it was the previous mayor Ken Livingstone who created the trend for mega-development in effect telling developers (I paraphrase) “I don’t care how big it is as long as 50 per cent is mine for social and affordable housing.”\\nLivingstone policy shifted social housing from a failing utopian model to the sidelines of a booming real estate market. The standard investment-led one- and two-bedroom apartment block was born at a time when money was cheap. Space standards plummeted; urban quality collapsed. We saw the emergence of a foot-loose community with little commitment to place: housing had been reduced to a commodity. \\xa0\\nWhen Boris came to power the Ken model had collapsed under the weight of the global banking crisis. But as we found out later the banks – and the big housebuilders they were in bed with – were too big to collapse. For the new mayor’s housing policy this meant one thing: drop the social and affordable housing requirement and plough on. London needs housing. Keep building. The big guys know best.\\nBoris as mayor was born into this complex and changing world. But he cannot escape the blame for what happened next. He could have made a big difference. He had the Olympics legacy and big chunks of land to do something with. He had the energy and creativity of the capital in his favour. People were looking for something new: he had a mandate to develop a new London way of doing things.\\nHe promised change. And his words in the London Housing Design Guide suggested bold ambitions:\\nWe are building places to live in a city with unique character with examples of great housing and city-making at a range of densities. London’s terraced houses apartment buildings streets squares and the best of 20th century development have created highly successful residential environments with enduring appeal.\\nMy housing strategy aspires to encourage a new London vernacular that can take its place in this rich fabric.\\nYet what followed was a catalogue of errors – or at best serious misjudgements. Here are 10.\\n1) Boris appointed his chum Richard Blakeway as his deputy mayor for housing. An international policy wonk Blakeway knew nothing about delivering housing in the capital so was a very strange appointment for such a crucial role in London. Boris allowed him to bungle along for his entire term making all the right noises but achieving little.\\nJust compare him with Martin Muller the former deputy mayor for Berlin who led on such game-changing housing projects as Self-Made City and the Berlin Townhouse project. Blakeway was a disaster for London.\\n2) Boris surprisingly retained many of the top city officials who blissfully continued in their role as box-checkers and bean counters at a time when we needed enlightened thinking and action. Some of them were at the birth of London’s housing crisis helping with its delivery.\\nThis group saw no way forward other than getting the big guys to solve their problems. Vast chunks of London’s housing estates were parcelled up to the big few. There was no imagination no willingness to try anything different and no desire to allow others to do so. They protected their patch and defended against change. Much of the blame can be laid at their feet.\\n3) Shortly after he arrived Boris abolished Design for London. The agency’s head Peter Bishop – London’s best shot of having a city architect again – was banished to the far-flung reaches of his London Development Agency. Here was one of London’s most valuable assets being wasted for political reasons. What was left behind was a band of amateurs with little experience of being at the coalface of housing.\\n4) The mayor’s housing guide originally been commissioned by Ken and led by the Head of Design for London was intended to be a comprehensive neighbourhood design guide showing the London Way of doing things. But under this team of box-checkers bean counters and amateurs it became little more than an uninspiring space standards manual that missed the whole point: another wasted opportunity.\\n5) Boris and his team dallied with self-build community housing trusts and new family housing models but nothing ever got off the ground. More complex policies were written; more unrealisable targets were set; more bold and brave announcements followed. More opportunity sites were declared more big masterplans with even greater unrealistic expectations held London to ransom. More hearts sunk.\\n6) Boris sold the best bits of land to others. The Chinese got the Royal Docks one of London’s best opportunity sites. The Qatari Development Agency got a big chunk of the Olympic Village; the rest of the Olympic Legacy sites are being parcelled up to sell to the big players.\\nIt seemed that the only game in London was to parcel up big chunks sell it to the big players and wait for them to deliver. When they didn’t we sold them more or gave them more money.\\nWhy did Boris sell the family silver? Berlin has shown how smaller developers could deliver housing 40 per cent cheaper on land with the same relative value as London by dealing directly with the end-users. So why didn’t Boris cut out the middle man and deliver smaller chunks of land to smaller players on land controlled by his authority?\\n7) When nothing happens where does his team go to for advice? To those who have a vested interest in the status quo – the big developers and their mega-consultants. It was like the foxes and the weasels advising the farmer on pest control.\\nNew ideas for housing were invited. The big guys and their megaconsultants helped to judge them. The status remained quo.\\n8) Despite Boris’s calls for a new London vernacular there is sheer lack of imagination about what London’s rich building fabric might be. The big guys are producing housing as large chunks of exclusive development not as the smaller individual building blocks that normally make up our socially-diverse and inclusive neighbourhoods.\\nEvery scheme appears to be a victim of bigness. Every scheme calls for unique brand. Every scheme is a “Square” a “Quarter” a “Village. Nothing adds to London’s unique character. Nothing hangs together.\\n9) The housing crisis has spawned the growing trend of “beds-in-sheds” across London. In one way this is symptomatic of creative people solving their own housing problems. In another it is simply the exploitation of desperate tenants.\\nBoris never showed any leadership in dealing with this issue. He should have found a way of capturing this energy and allow for positive intensification of our sprawling suburbs.\\n10) Boris and his team have made some disastrous decisions on major schemes in the capital. He circumvented the local planning process to take the decision on the Mount Pleasant scheme another monolithic development that will diminish the rich urban fabric of Clerkenwell.\\xa0 His shabby support for the megastructural Earls Court Project was yet another reflection of the fact that he was never committed to the ambitions he set out in his own guide.\\nCaught in a crisis fuelled by his own lack of leadership anything became acceptable to show the numbers.\\nOur new mayor Sadiq Khan has a lot to sort out.

The truth is almost all London’s land is already used for something – and changing its use is slow expensive and hard.\\nBrownfield must deliver much of the housing London needs but a\\xa0 new report \\xa0by Quod and homelessness charity\\xa0 Shelter\\xa0 finds that brownfield will not be enough – and urges the next mayor not to rule out other approaches.\\nClick to expand.\\nSo how is London’s land used?\\xa0About two-thirds of the developed land already has housing on it. Of the rest most is used for transport (including 15000 km of roads) town centres and vital urban infrastructure like schools and hospitals.\\nClick to expand.\\nThat leaves about 9 per cent of London which is essentially “employment land”. This is used for\\xa0all sorts of things – light industry distribution depots leisure retail warehouses sewage works.\\nClick to expand.\\nTo build housing on this land means removing something else first. That can and should be done in many places – but it is slow difficult and expensive. It may mean finding a new place for existing uses decontaminating land and building new stations or other infrastructure.\\nThis painstaking land-use change is happening in many places already – so what scope is there for more to be done?\\nAbout half of non-housing brownfield land that is currently in employment uses – the half that is most suitable for redevelopment – is already earmarked for change in the mayor’s “Opportunity Areas”. Tens of thousands of homes are being built in places such as Kings Cross Stratford and Nine Elms. This is already part of London’s current land supply.\\nIf brownfield is to deliver more on top of these Opportunity Areas some very difficult choices need to be made. Getting more out of brownfield is not an “easy option” – and if brownfield is our only option it is highly unlikely that London will be able to build enough new homes quickly enough.\\nThe history of successful brownfield developments in London – like Kings Cross or Vauxhall/Nine Elms/Battersea – is that it can take many decades to deliver and may finally need major public investment in infrastructure.\\nWe can get more from brownfield but it will not be quick and it will not be cheap. And we cannot expect it to deliver all the homes London so urgently needs. To fill\\xa0the current gap in delivery using brownfield alone would mean the equivalent of another Olympic Legacy sized scheme every three months or so on top of what we’re already building. Other options simply must not\\xa0be ruled out.\\nWe cannot carry on as we are and expect housing delivery to double. We have to change things if we want enough homes. The level of housebuilding we need now has only been (briefly) achieved twice in the past – once through major public investment in council housing and once through major expansion on greenfield land.\\xa0\\nThroughout London’s history the private sector has never built more than 18000 homes a year on brownfield land. To meet the city’s housing needs we have to consider other options.\\nTomorrow we’ll look at one of those options: garden cities.\\nBarney Stringer is a director at regeneration consultancy Quod.

England’s greatest architect envisioned a city of wide intersecting boulevards with vistas and squares inspired by the renaissance layout of Paris.\\nCharles II was keen on the idea. But lack of funds to buy the land and the insistence of the City merchants that they get back to business as soon as possible rather than hang around while a new plan was devised meant that the Square Mile was rebuilt largely to the old medieval plan.\\nThis pragmatic approach to planning has characterised much of the development of the capital ever since. England’s common law and a national distrust of grand plans have conspired to produce a system of creating pieces of city that come about as a result of argument and enquiry rather than from a vision of a desirable city.\\nWren’s abandoned plan. Image courtesy of the Design Museum.\\nAs London grew in the 18th and 19th century so the existing surrounding settlements expanded until they formed a single and untidy metropolis. The aristocratic estates like Bedford Grosvenor and Portman hired developers who laid out houses in streets and squares that followed a masterplan. This generated local areas of coherence like the white stucco and Classical architecture of Belgravia and the red terracotta of Arts and Crafts Chelsea. This mixture of single owner developments and areas of variety of style and ownership is a key part of the London’s character – the “city of villages”.\\nToday one has to ask whether the pressures of growth and of global finance combined with cuts in planning resources are creating places that are outgrowing these empirical methods. In the current London Plan large scale development is proposed to take place in Opportunity Areas. Some of these come under a single development entity like Argent’s King’s Cross and CapCo’s Earls Court. Others have multiple ownership like Nine Elms and South Quay on the Isle of Dogs. The two mayoral development corporations for the Olympic Legacy and Old Oak Common create masterplans with developers delivering individual sites.\\nKing’s Cross is a good example of how masterplanning can work. The developers and their consultants produced a clear layout for the site retaining areas of key heritage and providing locations and size of buildings with a mix of uses around the site. The plan was flexible enough to change as economic situation changed; based on a series of sound rules it retained a level of coherence in scale and detail. The architects of individual buildings were given freedom in developing their own palette of materials and colour in order to create variety and interest.\\nBy contrast South Quay not far from Canary Wharf on the DLR is in multiple ownership. Each landowner jockeys for taller and taller buildings with guidance arriving late in the day from the authorities when it seemed that the density of the area could exceed even that of Central Hong Kong. Although a master plan has now been developed it gives no hint as to the overall form the townscape of this key part of the capital.\\nThis is in contrast to Canary Wharf next door where today’s development is still recognisable in drawings made by the celebrated architectural illustrator Carlos Dinez as far back as 1984. The architecture has changed over time but the shape of the development is pretty much as planned.\\nSo in areas of multiple ownership how do we create plans that can adapt to changing circumstance yet create new quarters that are also great places?\\nWhat is needed is a wholesale shift from the current reactive and regulatory planning system to one that is proactive positive and creative. This was clearly stated in The Farrell Review prepared for former culture minister Ed Vaizey but fell on deaf ears in a Government committed to stripping out planning services in local authorities. Will Theresa May’s administration be any different?\\nThe NLA’s model of modern London.\\xa0\\nThe process of shaping the city in a way that is accessible to public and professional alike can be facilitated using 3D computer models which also allow the desired flexibility. The Corporation of London is already using virtual modelling to plan the layout of tall buildings in the City and New London Architecture (NLA) has been pressing City Hall to adopt a London-wide version ever since the publication of the NLA’s first Tall Buildings Survey in 2014 which highlighted the new for a more coherent skyline strategy.\\nProviding a clearer idea of the shape of the future city will give greater certainty to developers and communities alike; it will reassure local people about what is going up in their backyard will reduce land speculation and make development less of a gamble.\\nAs mayor Sadiq Khan writes his own version of the London Plan he has the opportunity to say not just what the London of the future will contain how many people it can accommodate and what sort of jobs they will do – he can give us an idea of what it is actually going to be like.\\nPeter Murray is chair of New London Architecture.\\n“Experiencing the city: What makes London work?” is part of the talks programme at 100% Design which has been curated by the Design Museum taking place 21-14 September at London Olympia.\\xa0\\nAll images in this article apear\\xa0courtesy of NLA and the Design Museum.\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'Share on Facebook\\nWe know –\\xa0we were practically born knowing –\\xa0that there isn’t enough housing in London. The Independent found in 2015 that tens of thousands of families seeking council accommodation have been moved out of London entirely because there simply isn’t enough space.\\nAnd yet in one single borough over 1000 council flats are currently standing empty. In Hackney 18 estates are up for “regeneration” (which usually means demolition) and as they wait to be regenerated the council is emptying them out.\\xa0So Sisters Uncut a group which campaigns against domestic violence cuts have decided to put just one of them to good use. On Saturday 9 July\\xa0they marched from Hackney Town hall and occupied a flat on the ground floor of the Marion Court estate in Hackney.\\nThe flat is nice. Really nice. The walls are fully plastered and the group have replaced the missing carpets and installed curtains adorned with the green and purple Sisters Uncut logo.The campaigners\\xa0tell me that their next door neighbour’s flat is in worse condition;\\xa0and yet feet away this flat was standing completely empty. I wondered if they had to break in to start the occupation but no – the door was simply unlocked.\\xa0\\n“All we did was clean put some carpets down and bring in furniture which was donated or we found on Freecycle” one of the Sisters (the activists generally prefer to remain anonymous) tells me.\\nA list of requested donations in the occupied flat. Image: author’s own.\\nThe flat’s good condition is part of the key message of the occupation: there is unused good-quality well-sized\\xa0housing scattered all over London. “Someone now living on this estate was moved out to Basildon while she was doing her GCSEs and eventually moved back here” one Sister tells me. “This is a beautiful three bedroom flat\\xa0lying empty. To say there are no properties for her to live in while she does her studies is an outrageous lie.”\\nSisters Uncut are here\\xa0for two reasons. First they want to use the otherwise wasted space as a community centre for the local area which they’ll keep open “as long as possible”. People can drop by whenever they like for a chat to donate food or other supplies or come for the children’s breakfast club between 7 and 9 every morning. “We’re also holding housing workshops this week where people can learn their housing rights” one sister tells me. \\xa0\\nBut they’re also here to make a statement. The group have four key demands for Hackney council which are inspired by their work for victims of domestic violence but also gesture at the housing crisis as a whole: no more council flats to be lost as part of regeneration projects; women fleeing domestic violence to be housed in refuges or self-contained properties not B&Bs; fill the borough’s 1047 empty council properties immediately; and refuse to implement the Housing Act (which would allow for rent rises and further evictions).\\xa0Philip Glanville Hackney’s deputy mayor has agreed to speak to the group about their demands though hasn’t confirmed yet when.\\nIn the 1970s over 40 per cent of Brits live in council housing; now that proportion is just 8 per cent. Put simply Sisters Uncut want protection for council homes not least because a better system could save the lives and livelihoods of those trying to flee abusive relationsips. “It may sound old fashioned” one tells me “but we just want proper council housing. That’s what works.”\\xa0\\nWhile the problems around maintaining council housing in an increasingly expensive city may seem intractable the Sisters argue that they are not – and practical solutions are available. Empty properties should be used and one Sister suggests that the council should have tried building more expensive “penthouse” apartments on top of existing council blocks or built more housing on the gaps between blocks to make money. “At the moment we’re seeing zero creative solutions” she says.\\nThese problems are endemic across a city which has a questionable definition of “affordable housing” ( 80 per cent of market rates ) and which often allows developers to dodge even measly affordable housing minumums by paying off councils . So why did the group choose Hackney?\\n“There are lots of empty homes here” one Sister says. But another adds: “Hackney was\\xa0home to the riots. Since then the council just hasn’t been listening to the local people. We have an Olympic legacy of nothing.\\n“The only legacy is seeing our communities socially cleansed out.”\\nFollow Sisters Uncut for more information on the occupation here .\\nThis article is from the CityMetric archive: some formatting and images may not be present.\\n', 'Share on Facebook\\nAs anyone who’s taken a night bus in South East London can attest the last place on Earth you want to find yourself stuck is halfway up the Walworth Road between the Elephant and Camberwell. And yet that’s the fate of Burgess Park a green wedge whose other end reaches the Old Kent Road.\\nBut it wasn’t always thus: once this was all fields or whatever it is actually goes on in the countryside. Then with the 1800s came INDUSTRY – a canal came through London came down and the open land had vanished under houses and factories. Later that century you’d get various philanthropists and do-gooders suggesting that at the very least it might be nice to let miserably poor people stand on a bit of grass while they’re being miserable and poor but it was too late for this particular bit of London.\\nAnd then came the greatest force in British urban planning: the Luftwaffe. They dropped enough bombs on it for Sir Patrick Abercrombie’s 1943 County of London Plan to recommend it as a site for new green space – something the immediate area was already sorely lacking and would require even more of thanks to plans to develop housing estates in the area. (An irony: as the wheel of regeneration has turned those estates have since come under threat or even outright demolished possibly in part because the nice green park makes an ideal place for a property developer to stick some nice posh flats next to.)\\nThe area in 1945. Image: Ordnance Survey.\\nAs it turned out creating the new park was not exactly an overnight endeavour. For a start while there had been bomb damage it was far from total obliteration and plenty of people still lived and worked in the area. Until the 1960s it remained the site of factories producing R. White’s lemonade (local legend states that this was on occasion used to put out fires after bombing raids) and bibles (praise be to him for giving us this lemonade presumably).\\nSlowly local authorities and eventually the Greater London Council acquired land as the factories closed and houses were deemed unfit for habitation. But this work was sloooow (which to be fair the Abercrombie Plan had predicted it would be). By the 1970s thirty years after the idea had been proposed the site was still something of a patchwork. And it didn’t even have a proper name just a bureaucratic designation as “North Camberwell Open Space”.\\nFinding a permanent name for it appears to have been something of a headache. A Name That Park competition was tried – local authorities don’t try this now unless you want a park named #ParkyMcParkFaceLOLFBPE – and either through that or inertia the park briefly got the name ‘St George’s’ presumably after the nearby church.\\xa0Finally in 1974 it gained the name it’s been known by since –\\xa0in honour of Jessie Burgess the first female mayor of Camberwell.\\nThe somewhat sedate progress made the whole enterprise slightly contentious – especially if you were one of the people who’d been already been kicked out of your home for it one imagines. There were even proposals to abandon the idea entirely and Build More Bloody Houses™ – but these were fought off and by 1982 the park had even acquired a lake whose bottom could boast that it was had the largest plastic sheet lining in the world.\\nSadly it is lacking what might have seemed like a more obvious water feature: the canal which ran through the site for nearly 150 years. Shut down in the 1940s because road transport made its original purpose redundant it was filled in and gone by 1960. No-one foresaw that one day post-industrial urban waterways could become attractive features in their own right: the disused canal was a dangerous rubbish dump you had to warn your kids to stay away from. The most obvious evidence for its existence is one of the park’s more notable sights: a bridge over nothing leading you nowhere.\\nThe bridge to nowhere. Image: Robin Stott.\\nAs late as the early 21st century Burgess Park still had the feeling of being somewhat unloved crisscrossed with bits of abandoned road that no-one had bothered to do anything about. In a rare moment of not being totally crap in 2009 Boris Johnson launched his “Help a London Park” scheme which among other things invested £2 million in sorting Burgess Park out once and for all. While this was broadly speaking good news for the local community it was also linked to wider “regeneration” efforts in the area i.e. trying to kick existing residents out of the nearby Aylesbury estate for the purposes of knocking it down and gentrifying it.\\nSo is Burgess Park finally finished? Maybe not – In 2013 it acquired a flashy new BMX track thanks to an Olympic Legacy Fund. And Southwark Council still occasionally seem to be finding bits of land to buy up: in 2015 a new entrance was opened on the site of a former architectural salvage yard. Maybe they’ll just keep going buying up more and more land until it achieves its ultimate form.

      "Celebrating the legacy of London 2012 at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\n",
      "In the summer of 2017, the eyes of the world will once again be on the London Stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park when, for the first time ever, the World ParaAthletics Championships and the IAAF World Championships will be held in the same city in the same summer.\n",
      "Thursday 27 July 2017\n",
      "Five years on from hosting the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the former Olympic Park is ready to welcome back world-class athletes and spectators to be a part of the legacy that was such a huge focus of the London 2012 bid.\n",
      "London 2012\n",
      "Following London’s successful bid to host the Games in 2005, a huge programme of clearing and cleaning took place in Stratford; 200 buildings were removed, 52 electricity pylons were taken away and 200 hectares of brownfield land, waterways, and rail lines were transformed. Wasteland made way for world class sports venues, and 17,000 athletes and officials from 204 nations were housed on the former home of Europe’s largest fridge mountain. In total, 14 temporary and permanent venues were built, 20km of new roads were added, 13km of new tunnels were created, 26 bridges were developed and 80 hectares of parkland was added to the site. At the heart of everything that was done was the legacy; in fact, 75p in every £1 that was spent for the Games, had legacy benefits, and the impact of this can be seen on the Park today. \n",
      "Post-Games Transformation\n",
      "For London, the Games were just the beginning. The closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games marked the start of a brand new chapter for the Park. An ambitious 18 month programme was undertaken by the London Legacy Development Corporation to transform the 560 acre site designed specifically to host four weeks of sport, into Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park – a new heart for east London and a destination for millions to live, work and visit.\n",
      "All eight permanent venues underwent their own transformations to ensure they were suitable for both the local community and world class athletes. The temporary seating wings at the London Aquatics Centre were removed, brand new BMX, road and mountain bike tracks were built at Lee Valley VeloPark, and a comprehensive programme at the London Stadium saw the installation of new lights, seating, and the world’s largest single cantilevered roof.\n",
      "In July 2013, just one year after the Games, the north of the Park reopened with new playgrounds and café’s as well as beautiful parklands to explore. Just nine months later in April 2014, the south of the Park reopened, and where once paved pathways dominated, there are now landscaped gardens and adventure playgrounds for people to enjoy. \n",
      "Today\n",
      "Today the Park is open 24 hours, entry is free and over 16 million people have already enjoyed the parklands, venues and events. Tens of thousands of people have enjoyed large scale concerts and sporting events in the venues as well as community focussed local events. \n",
      "With membership prices the same as those at other leisure centres across east London, the venues are accessible to the whole community and well used by local people. Over 2.5 miilion people have made a splash at the London Aquatics Centre, which also teaches 1,400 school children a week to swim, 2 million have enjoyed the Lee Valley VeloPark, and 1.5 million people have visited the Copper Box Arena. The Slide at the ArcelorMittal Orbit regularly sells out during school holidays and has received rave reviews as one of the best activities in London despite only just celebrating its first birthday.  \n",
      "The Stadium was the last venue to reopen. Even before transformation had been completed, the venue hosted a number of events including the Rugby World Cup 2015, international Rugby League, motorsport, and the Anniversary Games. It is now the national competition centre for UK Athletics and a new home for West Ham United Football Club, and has already hosted four hugely successful concerts this summer alone. \n",
      "The Park’s commitment to a community sporting and Paralympic legacy continues to go from strength to strength. The Active People, Active Park programme has taken 260,300 free sporting opportunities out to the local community since 2014, and includes a dedicated £1.7 million programme, Motivate East, which has so far taken almost 90,000 free sporting opportunities to disabled people. As part of the Paralympic legacy, the Park has also supported the creation of the Global Disability Innovation Hub which brings together partners, local communities, academics, and disabled people to drive innovation, co-design, and think creatively. \n",
      "And the Park is not just a place to visit, many people are now choosing to live and work here. East Village, the former Athletes’ Village, is fully occupied and residents have already moved into the Park’s first new neighbourhood, Chobham Manor, one of five to be built over the next decade. Work is also already underway on East Wick and Sweetwater, the next two neighbourhoods to be built and, in September 2016, Mossbourne Riverside Academy opened as the first new school at the Park. Here East, the former Press and Broadcast Centre, is fast becoming a space for innovation, education and enterprise and is home to a fantastic mix of tech, education and culture, with tenants such as BT Sport, Loughborough University London, Plexal, and Studio Wayne McGregor. Thousands of new jobs have been created at Here East as well as across the Park venues and through the construction work that has taken place, many of which have been filled by local people. \n",
      "Following on from the Games, the Park also continues to ‘inspire a generation’, not just through the amazing venues and sports on offer but through its high accessibility and sustainability standards. Through these plans, the Park has already delivered innovations such as the multi-generational home, the largest free-to-access wifi network in an urban parkland, and recognition of the Park as a European Smart, Sustainable District. \n",
      "The Future\n",
      "And we’re not done yet! There will be 40,000 jobs on the Park by 2025 and 24,000 homes will be built on and around the Park by 2031. Development will continue with the new Cultural and Education District which will bring world-class institutions to east London and will include plans for new campuses for UCL (University College London) and UAL’s London College of Fashion as well as additional sites for the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Smithsonian, and Sadler’s Wells Theatre. International Quarter London is already underway with two new headquarters being built for the Financial Conduct Authority and Transport for London, and Westfield Stratford City continues its success with almost 50 million people passing through its doors every year.\n",
